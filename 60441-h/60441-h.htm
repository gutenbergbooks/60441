<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line1.png" alt="Ornamental line" width="250" height="15" />
</div>

<div class="introduction">

<p class="noindent">The School of Musketry was founded in 1853, by the then Commander-in-Chief, the
late Viscount Hardinge, as a normal school of instruction in Musketry.</p>

<p>It has for its especial object the formation of officers and non-commissioned officers
to act as instructors in the several battalions throughout the Army.</p>

<p>In the book of &#8220;Regulations for conducting the Musketry Instruction of the Army,&#8221;
promulgated by order of His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief, it is ordered at
page 33, and paragraph 35, that, &#8220;The Commanding Officer is to assemble the officers
of the battalion at least once in each half-year, and to cause the non-commissioned
officers and men to be assembled occasionally by squads or companies, at other times
than when the annual course is proceeding, when the officer-instructor, having previously
explained the theoretical principles detailed in the foregoing lessons, will be at liberty
to advance deeper into the subject, developing to a degree proportionate to the rank
and intelligence of his auditors, the whole history of small arms, from the first invention
of gunpowder, and the successive steps by which the rifle-musket has attained its present
efficiency; in order that the officers and soldiers, by acquiring a thorough knowledge
of the subject theoretically, may take a greater interest in the practical part of this
most important branch of their duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following Lectures have been prepared for the use of officers qualifying at the
School of Musketry for the positions of Instructors in their respective Regiments. They
are not to be considered as complete treatises or histories, but merely as &#8220;aids&#8221; to instruction,
which can be expanded by the Instructor in viva voce Lectures, and if bound
with an alternate ruled blank leaf, they may be corrected and enlarged when desirable,
to suit the various improvements in arms, &amp;c., introduced from time to time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pageii">[ii]</span></p>

<p>These Lectures are a mere compilation, extracted from a vast amount of interesting
and valuable matter, systematically arranged. The names of the various authors upon
whom wholesale plunder has been committed are mentioned in the course of the work,
and the compiler hopes this general confession may secure their pardon.</p>

<p>The Theory of Gunnery has been very slightly touched upon: it cannot be pursued
by any persons unless well grounded in Mathematics, and the short time passed by officers
at Hythe wholly precludes so abstruse a study. Our School is decidedly a practical institution;
to acquire an art or skill is our object, and we only broach the subject of
Theory to soldiers, so far as to enable them to understand the reasons for all those rules
which have to be attended to in practice.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF GUNPOWDER.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p>The History of Gunpowder may well form a prelude to that of Fire Arms, as
the existence of the latter is wholly dependent on the discovery of the former. Of
all the discoveries which have been made, there is, perhaps, none which has produced
more important consequences to mankind than the discovery of Gunpowder, as by
introducing fire-arms, and a new method of fortifying, attacking, and defending
Towns, it wrought a complete change in the whole art of war.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Knock&#8217;s
opinion.</p>

<p>The invention of Gunpowder is completely involved in obscurity, and this very
fact is one great proof of its antiquity. Knock observes that the invention of Gunpowder
comprises several discoveries, which it is necessary to distinguish from each
other.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Order of
discovery.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The discovery of Nitre, the principal ingredient, and the cause of its
detonation.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;The mixture of nitre with sulphur and charcoal, which, properly speaking,
form gunpowder.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;The application of powder to fire-works.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;Its employment as a propelling agent for throwing stones, bullets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Its employment in springing mines and destroying fortifications.</p>

<p>All these discoveries belong to different periods.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mr. Duten&#8217;s
account.</p>

<p>Mr. Dutens carried the antiquity of gunpowder very high; and refers to the
accounts given by Virgil, and others, of Salmonens&#8217; attempt to imitate thunder,
presuming from hence that he used a composition of the nature of Gunpowder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Known in
China, A.&nbsp;D.
85.</p>

<p>It has been said that it was used in China as early as the year
<span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 85, and that
the knowledge of it was conveyed to us from the Arabs, on the return of the
Crusaders to Europe.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Known in
India, A.&nbsp;D.
250.</p>

<p>The Brahmas and Indians, whose practice is recorded by Philostratus, in his
life of Appolonius Tyan&#339;us, written about 1600 years ago. &#8220;These truly wise men,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;dwell between the rivers Hyphasis and Ganges; their country Alexander
never entered, their cities he never could have taken, for they come not out to the
field to fight those who attack them, but they overthrow their enemies with tempests
and thunderbolts, shot from their walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a most striking illustration of the antiquity of Gunpowder, for if some
such composition be not implied in the foregoing quotation, it must remain for ever
perfectly unintelligible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span></p>

<p>Saltpetre, which is the principal ingredient of Gunpowder, is found in its natural
state in the East, and from this it seems highly probable they were acquainted with
the composition of Gunpowder before the Europeans.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Powder at
siege of Mecca,
A.&nbsp;D. 690.</p>

<p>The Arabs are said to have employed Gunpowder at the siege of Mecca, <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span>
690.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Oldest book
on gunpowder
A.&nbsp;D. 900.</p>

<p>There is a manuscript book still extant, entitled Liber Ignium, written by
Marcus Gr&aelig;cus, who lived about the end of the eighth century, and the composition
there prescribed is 6lbs. saltpetre, 2lbs. charcoal, 1lb. sulphur, to be well powdered
and mixed in a stone mortar.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Work on gunpowder
in Escurial
Collection
A.&nbsp;D. 1249.</p>

<p>There is in the Escurial Collection a treatise on Gunpowder, written in 1249.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Roger Bacon
on powder,
A.&nbsp;D. 1267.</p>

<p>Our countryman, Roger Bacon, who was born 1214, and published works at
Oxford 1267, expressly mentions the ingredients of Gunpowder, not as any new
discovery, but as a well known composition, used for recreation. He describes it as
producing a noise like thunder, and flashes like lightning, but more terrible than
those produced by nature; and adds that it might be applied to the destruction of an
army or a city. Bacon, in his treatise &#8220;De Secretis Operibus,&#8221; says that from saltpetre,
sulphur, and wood coals, we are able to make a fire that shall burn at any
distance we please.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tradition of
Schwartz,
A.&nbsp;D. 1320.</p>

<p>The common tradition of Bartholdus Schwartz having invented Gunpowder and
Artillery, about 1320, is without the slightest foundation, but he might possibly have
suggested the simplest application of it to warlike purposes, in consequence of some
accidental explosion while mixing the ingredients in a <span class="sidenote">Mortar.</span>
mortar. Indeed, the name, as
well as the form of the old species of artillery, which was employed to throw large
bullets at an elevation, strongly corroborate this conjecture; but Schwartz cannot lay
any claim to originality of invention.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Powder made
in the reign
of Richard II.
1378.</p>

<p>Gunpowder was made in England in the fourteenth century, as Richard II. commissioned
Sir Thomas Norwich to buy, in London, or in any other place, certain
quantities of &#8220;sulphur, saltpetre, and charcoal,&#8221; for making Gunpowder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tartaglia on
Powder,
A.&nbsp;D. 1500.</p>

<p>Tartaglia, at the commencement of the sixteenth century, sets down twenty-three
different compositions, made use of at different times, the first of which, being the
most ancient, consists of equal parts of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ancient gunpowder
weak.</p>

<p>Gunpowder, for some time after the invention of artillery, was of a composition
much weaker than what we now use, or than that ancient one mentioned by Marcus
Gr&aelig;cus; but this, it is presumed, was owing to the weakness of their first pieces,
rather than to the ignorance of a better mixture.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Graining.</p>

<p>The change of the proportion of the materials composing it was not the only
improvement it received. The invention of graining it is doubtless a considerable
advantage to it; for powder, at first, was always in the form of fine meal, such as it
was reduced to by grinding the materials together. It is doubtful whether the first
graining of powder was intended to increase its strength, or only to render it more
convenient for the filling into small charges, and the charging of small arms, to which
alone it was applied for many years, whilst meal-powder was still made use of in
cannon. But at last the additional strength which the grained powder was found to<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
acquire from the free passage of the fire between the grains, occasioned the meal-powder
to be entirely laid aside.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tartaglia
wrote, 1537.</p>

<p>That powder was first used in meal, and continued in its old form for cannon
long after the invention of graining it for small arms, are facts not to be contested.
Tartaglia expressly asserts that in his time cannon-powder was in meal, and the
musket-powder grained. <span class="sidenote">William
Bourne, 1577.</span>And our countryman, William Bourne, in his &#8220;Art of
Shooting in great Ordnaunce,&#8221; published forty years after Tartaglia, tells us, in chap.
I, that serpentine powder, (which he opposes to corn, or grained-powder) should be
as fine as sand, and as soft as flour: and in his third chapter he says that two pounds
of corn-powder will go as far as three pounds of serpentine-powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tartaglia on
the proportions.</p>

<p>We learn from Tartaglia, that the cannon-powder was made of four parts saltpetre,
one part sulphur, and one part charcoal; and the musket-powder of forty-eight
parts saltpetre, seven parts sulphur, and eight parts charcoal; or of eighteen parts
saltpetre, two parts sulphur, and three parts charcoal. These compositions for musket
powder are very near the present standard; the first having, in one hundred pounds
of powder, about one pound of saltpetre more than is at present allowed, and the
second three pounds more.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Nye&#8217;s treatise
on the proportions.</p>

<p>Nye, in his treatise on fireworks, gives the proportions of the ingredients, and the
dates when they are used, thus in 1380 equal parts of each were employed. This
would be about as efficient as a common squib of the present time. In 1410, three
parts saltpetre, two sulphur, and two charcoal. In 1520, for the best powder, four
parts saltpetre, one sulphur, and one charcoal, and afterwards, five saltpetre, one
sulphur, and one charcoal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early gunpowder
mere
mixture.</p>

<p>In fact, Gunpowder was merely those substances, combined, with little or no
purification. It was not at first corned or grained, as at present, but remained in its
mealed state, and was called &#8220;serpentine powder,&#8221; in several accounts of stores in
the time of Edward VI., and Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Two kinds.</p>

<p>Soon after this two kinds of powder were used for the same gun, one in its
mealed state (for priming only) as being more readily ignited by the match, the
other, corned or grained, for the charge in the gun barrel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Powder first
used to explode
mines in
15th century.</p>

<p>The application of powder to mines, and to the destruction of fortifications, does
not appear to have been in practice before the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elizabeth had
powder made,
1558 to 1603.</p>

<p>Camden, in his life of Queen Elizabeth, says that she was the first who procured
Gunpowder to be made in England, that she might not pray and pay for it also to
her neighbours; but it has been stated that it was previously made in the reign of
Richard II.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Charles I. from
A.&nbsp;D. 1625 to
1649.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Manwayring, in his Seaman&#8217;s Dictionary, presented to the Duke of
Buckingham, in the time of Charles 1st, under the word powder, tells us, &#8220;There
are two kinds of powder, the one serpentine-powder, which powder is dust (as it
were) without corning. The other is &#8220;corn-powder;&#8221; though he informs us the
serpentine-powder was not used at sea. Indeed, when that book was written, it is
believed powder was usually corned, for the foreign writers on artillery had long
before recommended its general use.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Causes which
checked the
progress of
Fire-Arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span></p>

<p>Various circumstances tended to check the progress of fire-arms, and the improvement
of artillery, for a long period after the invention of gunpowder. Custom
made most people prefer the ancient engines of war. The construction of artillery
was very awkward and imperfect; and the bad quality and manufacture of gunpowder,
so that it could produce but little effect; <span class="sidenote">Fire-Arms
supposed to
extinguish
bravery, and
to be contrary
to humanity.</span>and there was a general aversion
to the newly invented arms, as calculated to extinguish military bravery, and as being
contrary to humanity; but above all, the knights (whose science was rendered
completely useless by the introduction of fire-arms) opposed, with all their might,
this invention, <span class="sidenote">Fire-Arms
expensive and
powder difficult
to procure.</span>to which may be added the great cost and difficulty of procuring
gunpowder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rockets in

<p>It is known that iron rockets have been used in India as military weapons, time
out of mind. (See <a href="#Plate4">plate 4</a>, fig. 3.)</p>

<h3>GREEK FIRE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Discovered
by Callinicus.
A.&nbsp;D., 617.</p>

<p>The Greek Fire has been highly extolled for its wonderful effects, but it owed
much of its effect to the terrors and imagination of the beholders. It is said by the
Oriental Greeks, to have been discovered by Callinicus, an architect of Heliopolis or
Balbeck, in the reign of the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus, who, it is said, forbad
the art of making it to be communicated to foreigners, but it was at length known,
and in common use, among the nations confederated with the Byzantines.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Known in
China, 917.</p>

<p>It is also said to have been known in China in 917, being 300 years after
Constantine Pogonatus, under the name of &#8220;The oil of the cruelfire,&#8221; and was
carried thither by the Kitan Tartars, who had it from the King of Ou.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Wild fire
from the
Saracens.</p>

<p>It was thrown by machines, by the hand, and by cross bows, fastened to the
heads of arrows. The Crusaders obtained a knowledge of a sort of wild fire from the
Saracens, which could only be extinguished by dust or vinegar. It was composed of
the gum of resinous trees, reduced to powder with sulphur, to which was added
naptha, and other bitumens, and probably nitre.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Wild fire in
the Holy
Wars.</p>



<p>It is much spoken of in all the Holy Wars, as being frequently employed by
the Saracens against the Christians. Procopius, in his history of the Goths, calls
it Media&#8217;s oil, considering it an infernal composition prepared by that sorceress.
<span class="sidenote">Geoffrey de
Vinesauf&#8217;s
account.</span>Geoffrey de Vinesauf, who accompanied Richard I. to the Crusades, says that it
could not be extinguished by water, but that sand thrown upon it abated its virulence,
and vinegar poured upon it put it out. <span class="sidenote">Father
Daniel&#8217;s
account.</span>Father Daniel says this wild fire was
not only used in sieges, but even in battles, and that Philip Augustus, King of
France, having found a quantity of it ready prepared at Acre, brought it with him to
France, <span class="sidenote">Used at the
siege of
Dieppe.</span>and used it at the siege of Dieppe, for burning the English vessels in that
harbour.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Greek fire and
gunpowder,
both used at
the siege of
Ypres, 1383.</p>

<p>The Greek fire was used long after the invention of firearms; when the Bishop
of Norwich besieged Ypres, 1383, the garrison is said by Walsingham to have
defended itself so well, with stones, arrows, lances, and certain engines called guns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
that they obliged the English to raise the siege with such precipitation, that they left
behind them their great guns, which were of inestimable value.</p>

<p>Greek fire was probably a more recent invention than Gunpowder.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="sidenote">Powder used
by Arabs,
14th century.</p>

<p>It is ascertained that Gunpowder was employed by the Arabs as an agent
for throwing bolts and stones, about the commencement of the fourteenth century,
and that the Moors first availed themselves of its advantages in their wars with the
Spaniards. From Spain, the use of Gunpowder and Artillery gradually extended
itself to France, and thence over the other States of Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some idea of the importance of Gunpowder may be formed by the estimate of
the enormous quantity employed in sieges, and warfare generally.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Quantity used
in sieges.</p>

<p>At the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, January, 1812, 74,978lbs. were consumed in
30<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> hours; at Badajos, March, 1812, 228,830lbs. in 104 hours, and this from the
great guns only.</p>

<p class="sidenote">San Sebastian
and Zaragoza.</p>

<p>At the two sieges of San Sebastian, 502,110lbs. At Zaragoza, the French
exploded 45,000lbs. in the mines, and threw 16,000 shells.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sebastopol.</p>

<p>During the siege of Sebastopol, extending over a period of eleven months, the
enormous quantity of 2,775,360lbs., or 1,239 tons of gunpowder, were expended by
ourselves alone; 9,076 tons of shot and shell having been launched by us on that
memorable occasion, from 476 pieces of heavy ordnance; of which only 11 actually
burst, though 269 were rendered unserviceable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Quantity
made.</p>

<p>Some of our private manufactories make from 8 to 10,000 barrels of powder
a year in time of peace, and from 10 to 14,000 during war.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Quantity
proved by
Government.</p>

<p>The quantity of powder received and proved from Faversham, at the Royal
Magazines, and from the several powder makers contracting with Government,
amounted, during the several years from 1776 to 1782 inclusive, to 244,349 barrels
of 100 lbs. each, being equal, on an average, to 3,490,700lbs. annually. <span class="sidenote">Quantity in
store in 1783.</span>The quantity
of powder in store in Great Britain, Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man, in 1783,
was about 80,000 barrels.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gunpowder
used for works
of peace.</p>

<p>Sir George Staunton observes, that gunpowder in India and China seems coeval
with the most distant historic events, and that the Chinese have at all times applied
it to useful purposes, as the blasting of rocks, and also in the preparation of fireworks,
in which they greatly excel other nations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Powder used
at Woodhead
tunnel.</p>

<p>In blasting the Woodhead tunnel, in the county of Chester, not less than three
thousand five hundred barrels of gunpowder, weighing about one hundred and sixty
tons, were used in its formation. The average number of men employed was about
a thousand; and during the six years the works were in progress, twenty-six men
were killed. There were about 400 minor accidents, many of them attended with
loss of limb, and the sum total of the casualties, in proportion to the men employed,
was greater, according to Mr. Edwin Chadwick, than was suffered by the British
army in the battles of Talavera, Salamanca, Vittoria, and Waterloo.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Powder used
on S. Eastern
Railway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span></p>

<p>In the formation of the South-Eastern Railway, the blasts of the cliffs between
Dover and Folkestone have astonished even scientific men. On one occasion 18,500
pounds of gunpowder were ignited by galvanic action at the same instant, which
severed from the Round-down cliff, the height of which is 375 feet above the level of
the sea, more than 1,000,000 tons of chalk. The fallen mass extended 1200 feet
into the ocean, and covered a space of 18 acres. By another statement, the quantity
of earth moved by the explosion was 400,000 cubic yards, and was a saving to the
Company of &pound;7,000.</p>

<p class="sidenote">No. of men
employed at
Waltham
Abbey.</p>

<p>There are 134 men employed in the Government works at Waltham Abbey
in the manufacture of gunpowder, <span class="sidenote">Quantity
made.</span>who make about 9,000 barrels a year. The premises
are near two miles long, consisting of detached mills, &amp;c., on a small stream,
which runs through the whole length of the premises and communicates with the
Thames, whereby there is water-carriage to the Government Powder Magazines at
Purfleet. The barges conveying powder are not allowed to anchor in the river off
London during the night. Where two buildings are adjacent, there are frequently
heavy buttresses of masonry between them, and lightning conductors are placed in
great numbers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Saving to
Government.</p>

<p>There is a great saving, amounting to upwards of &pound;300,000, in the cost of powder,
when compared to the price paid to the merchants in seven years of the war
from 1809 to 1815, from the Government having Waltham Abbey, Faversham, and
Ballincollig.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Improved
Quality.</p>

<p>At Waltham Abbey, in a very few years after it was constructed, the powder
was so improved, that the charge of powder to the weight of shot was reduced from
one-half to one-third; therefore two barrels were used instead of three&mdash;an advantage
in stowing on board ship as well as in the field.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Made by
Contract.</p>

<p>A great part of the powder for H. M. Government has at present to be supplied
by merchants. The contracts are made out sometimes for them to supply their own
saltpetre, and at others for the Government to furnish it pure, at the rate of 77&middot;5 lbs.
per barrel of 100 lbs., they finding the other materials and manufacture, a corresponding
reduction in price being made: as, however, it has to come up in nearly all
respects to the sample, the requirements of which we shall state, certain
proofs have to be undergone before being received for the different services.</p>

<h3>SALTPETRE, OR NITRE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Nitre.</p>

<p>The principal ingredient in Gunpowder is an abundant production of Nature,
and is a combination of nitric acid with the vegetable alkali. It is never found pure,
being always contaminated with other salts and earthy matter. <span class="sidenote">Where found.</span>It is principally found
in the East Indies, Ceylon, and South America, and is sometimes produced from
decayed animal and vegetable matter. <span class="sidenote">Unfit in natural
state.</span>It is totally unfit for Gunpowder until it has
been refined; for, being combined with muriates of soda, lime, magnesia, and other
salts, which absorb moisture, the close contact of the ingredients would be deranged
by their presence, the strength of the powder weakened, and the power of resisting
the action of the atmosphere greatly lessened. As for the efflorescent salts it may
contain, they are noxious only inasmuch as, possessing no particular useful property,
they interpose their atoms between the more combustible ingredients, and impede the
rapidity of deflagration.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Two methods
of refining.</p>

<p>There are two methods of refining saltpetre at Waltham Abbey:&mdash;1st, the Old
Method, of re-crystallizing three times; and 2nd, the New Method, which has only
just been adopted, both of which we shall here briefly describe.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>OLD METHOD.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Old method.</p>

<p>About 35 cwt. of the grough saltpetre, as it is termed, viz., as it is imported in
its impure state, is put into a copper capable of holding 500 gallons, with 270 gallons
of water, in the proportion of about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>lbs. of nitre to 1lb. of water, (which proportion
varies with the quality of the saltpetre). This is allowed to boil, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
impurities are skimmed off as they appear on the surface. Cold water is occasionally
thrown in to precipitate portions of the chloride, which otherwise would remain on the
top by the action of boiling. After being allowed to boil from three and a half to
four hours, the furnace doors are thrown open, when the chlorides and salts fall to
the bottom. In about two hours, a copper pump is lowered into the liquor, which is
pumped out into a wooden trough, having four or five brass cocks, under which are
suspended canvas filtering bags in the shape of a V. The solution is then filtered,
and run off into pans, containing about 36 gallons, and allowed to remain for twenty-four
hours, to crystallize, when they are set up on edge, to drain off the liquor which
remains uncrystallized, and which is called mother liquor. The saltpetre thus
obtained is called once-refined, and undergoes the same process twice again, the only
difference being that there is a greater proportion to the water each time, viz. 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>lb.
to 1lb. of water the second time, and 2lb. to 1lb. of water the third time: moreover,
the third time, a small quantity of ground charcoal is put into the solution, and it
passes through double filters, which brings it to a very fine pure white colour when
melted. The mother water which remains in the pans after each crystallization is
conveyed away by gutters to cisterns under the building; it is then evaporated in
iron pots to one quarter of its original bulk, filtered, and allowed to crystallize. The
saltpetre obtained from the first mother water is considered one stage inferior to
grough; that from the second, equal to grough; that from the treble-refined, equal
to once-refined saltpetre. The water left from every stage is treated in the same
way, so that actually nothing is lost of the pure material. Saltpetre treble-refined by
this process is perfectly pure, and fit for the manufacture of Gunpowder; and in
order to free it from moisture, as well as for the convenience of storage and transport,
it is melted in iron pots holding about 4 cwt., <span class="sidenote">Saltpetre
fuzes at 600&deg;.</span>by raising it to a temperature of 600&deg;
Fahrenheit, and cast into gun-metal circular moulds holding about 38lbs. each. It
must be observed that it requires about two hours to bring the saltpetre into a liquid
state, and that, after this, the furnace doors are thrown open, to lower the heat to the
proper temperature for casting into the moulds. When the cakes are cold, they are
packed away in barrels containing 1 cwt., 1 qr. each, and put into store. Care must
be taken, in melting the saltpetre, not to raise it to too high a temperature, as this
would reduce the quantity of oxygen, and form nitrite of potash, which would render
it unfit as an ingredient in the composition of Gunpowder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A neutral
salt.</p>

<p>Saltpetre is a neutral salt, the constituents of which are 46.55 potash, and 53.45
nitric acid; the latter consisting of two volumes nitrogen and five of oxygen. It is
white, and of a fresh, sharp, and slightly bitter taste. It crystallizes in six-sided
prisms. Exposed to the air, it remains permanent unless impure, or that the atmosphere
is very moist.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>NEW METHOD.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">New method.</p>

<p>Forty cwt. of the grough saltpetre is put into a copper with 270 gallons of water,
and treated in precisely the same way as we have before described for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
refining; it is then filtered and run off into large troughs, about 10 feet long by 6 feet
wide, and 9 inches deep, lined with sheet copper; this liquor is then kept in a state
of agitation by a wooden rake, until nearly cold. By this process a large quantity
of very minute crystals are formed, which are collected as they form by a wooden
hoe, and shovelled with a spade on to a framework covered with copper sieving
resting on the opposite sides of the trough, and allowed to drain. These fine white
crystals, which have exactly the appearance of snow, when they have drained
sufficiently, are raked over in a washing cistern adjoining, which is about 6 feet long,
4 feet wide, and 3ft. 6in. deep, and fitted with a false wooden bottom that can be
removed at pleasure. Cold water is allowed to run on to the saltpetre in this cistern
till it is nearly level with the top. After remaining for an hour it is drained off, and
filled again with fresh water, which is drained off after about another hour. The
saltpetre thus obtained is perfectly pure, and equal in every respect to the treble-refined
by the old method. The water remaining in the cisterns after agitation, is
left till the next morning, when a quantity of larger crystals are formed on the
bottom and sides; these are equal to once-refined by the old method, and are used
with grough; the mother-liquor is then drained off, and evaporated in the usual way.
The water from each washing is conveyed into cisterns, and used with grough saltpetre
instead of water; but, as it contains a small portion of saltpetre in solution, a
lesser quantity of grough is used to make the proportions correct.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Drying.</p>

<p>The saltpetre flour, however, contains a certain degree of moisture, which has to
be dried off in the following way: two large copper trays, about 10 feet by 6 feet,
with a 3-inch rim, are fixed over flues heated by a furnace, 4 inches of sand being
between the flues and the bottom of the trays; the saltpetre is spread about 2 inches
deep all over, and raked about till dry; it is then barrelled up for use. It takes
about two hours to dry 5 cwt.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Comparison
of the two
methods.</p>

<p>On comparing the two systems, there cannot for one moment be a doubt as to
the immense advantages of the latter over the former. As an example, in the refinery
where this new process is carried on, the result (that is to say, pure saltpetre)
is obtained in one day instead of six, with less than one half the amount of labour
and coals.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Why new
method best.</p>

<p>On reflection, the reason of the great gain of time by this process will suggest
itself. In the former method, when allowed to remain quiet, the crystals formed are
very large, and the spaces left in them always contain a certain amount of mother-water,
which necessitates its being crystallized three times to perfectly free it from
the liquor. In the latter, the crystals are so minute that there is practically no space
for the mother-water to collect; consequently, by careful washing, the saltpetre is obtained
perfectly pure.</p>

<h3>CHARCOAL.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Charcoal.</p>

<p>Wood charcoal is the woody fibre that remains after the liquid and more volatile
parts have been driven off by the fire in the process of charring. The temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
resulting from the combustion of charcoal is much higher than that from burning
wood, in consequence of the absence of the large quantity of water which wood
contains, amounting to between 50 and 60 per cent.; <span class="sidenote">Object of
charring.</span>the object, therefore, of charring
wood is the removal of moisture, and also, what is of great importance, the expulsion
of those matters contained in it which become volatile before they are burned, thus
rendering a large amount of heat latent. <span class="sidenote">Best wood for
charcoal.</span>The woods generally used in this country
in making charcoal for gunpowder are the alder, willow, and dogwood. There are
about 60 acres of wood grown for charcoal at Waltham Abbey. The alder is cut
every eight years, and the willow in six years. It is used after one year. Other
woods are sometimes used by English and foreign manufacturers, but none produce a
powder of such quality as obtained from the above. It is usually considered that
better charcoal is distilled when the wood is allowed to season for a time; but
recent experience has shown that wood only lately cut and peeled, after being desiccated
in a hot chamber, will make equally good charcoal with that which has been
seasoning for three or four years.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First process.</p>

<p>All the wood which is cut in the Government grounds or purchased from merchants,
is stripped of the bark, on account of its being impregnated with salts and
gummy substances, cut into lengths of 3 feet for the convenience of loading the iron
slips, which are a little above this length, and stacked in the wood-yard.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cylinder
charcoal.</p>

<p>Cylindrical cases of the required size, fitted with lids, are filled with wood.
These cases are made to fit easily, and slide horizontally into iron retorts built in the
wall, which admit of the accurate regulation of heat (communicated to them by furnaces
underneath) throughout the operation of charring. A great saving of time and
heat is effected by their use, as when the wood has been properly charred the case
or slip containing it may be easily withdrawn, and another containing a fresh charge
at once introduced into the retort, without allowing the latter to cool down, as
would otherwise be necessary. When it has been sufficiently charred (which is
known by experience, in watching the burning of the gas that is produced and is
conducted into the fire), the slip is withdrawn by tackling, and at once lowered down
into iron coolers or cases, which are immediately covered up with close-fitting lids,
and then allowed to remain until all fire is extinguished. The goodness of charcoal
is an essential point in the manufacture of gunpowder. <span class="sidenote">Quantity
produced.</span>About twenty-five to thirty
per cent. is obtained; and one cord will produce about four cwt. of charcoal. <span class="sidenote">Qualities.</span>If
properly charred, it should have a jet black appearance, and when powdered a lustre
resembling velvet; it should be light and sonorous when gently dropped, and its
fracture should exhibit the same appearance throughout; it should be so soft as not
to scratch polished copper, and ought not to exhibit any alkali when treated with
pure distilled water. Charcoal is very porous, and absorbs very greedily gases and
moisture from the atmosphere; no large store therefore is ever kept, and particular
care is taken to prepare it only in proportion as it is required for use. <span class="sidenote">Kept dry.</span>At all times
it must be kept exceedingly dry; <span class="sidenote">Absorbs.</span>when whole it will absorb about eight per cent. its
weight of moisture, and when in powder 15 per cent., so that the fresher the
charcoal is the better for the powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span></p>

<h3>SULPHUR.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Sulphur.</p>

<p>Sulphur is a simple, combustible, solid, non-metallic, elementary body. It is
found generally in great quantities in the neighbourhood of volcanoes. It is also
obtainable from metallic ores, and readily fuzes. At 170&deg; Fahrenheit it begins to
evaporate; at 185&deg; to 190&deg; it melts; at 220&deg; it is perfectly fluid; and at 600&deg; it
sublimes. <span class="sidenote">How purified.</span>Sulphur is purified simply by melting: that which is supplied to Waltham
Abbey has been once refined, and the following is a description of the apparatus and
method for purifying and rendering it fit as an ingredient in Gunpowder. A large
iron pot is set about three feet off the ground, or about the height that an ordinary
boiling copper is placed, having a furnace underneath. This pot has a movable lid,
which is fixed into the top of the pot with clay, and in which lid is an iron conical
plug that can be removed at pleasure. From the pot lead two pipes, one to a large
circular dome, and another to an iron retort, rather below its level. The last-mentioned
pipe has a casing, or jacket, round it, which can be filled with cold water.
The communication of these pipes with the melting pot can be shut off or opened, as
occasion requires, by a mechanical arrangement. About 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 6 cwt. of the once-refined
sulphur is broken up into small pieces, placed in the iron melting pot, and
subjected to the action of the furnace. The plug in the lid, and the pipe leading to
the dome are now left open, but the pipe to the retort closed. After from two to
three hours a pale yellow vapour rises, when the plug is put in, and the vapour conducted
into the dome, where it condenses in the form of an impalpable powder,
commonly called flowers of sulphur. A small pipe leads from the bottom of the
dome, on the opposite side, into water, to allow the escape of the air, and sulphuric
acid is taken up by this water. In about one and a half to two hours after, the
vapour becomes of a deep iodine colour, when the communication with the dome is
shut, and the one to the retort opened; at the same time, cold water from a tank
above is allowed to pass into the jacket we have before mentioned, surrounding this
pipe. The vapour then which distils over is condensed in the pipe, and runs into the
retort below in the form of a thick yellow fluid. When nearly all has distilled, which
can be known by the jacket getting cold, the communication is again closed with the
retort, and the fluid sulphur left an hour, to get sufficiently cool to ladle out into
moulds, the furnace door and the communication with the dome at the same time are
again thrown open, that the rest of the vapour may pass into the latter. <span class="sidenote">Flowers of
sulphur
unsuitable.</span>The flowers
of sulphur thus obtained are used for laboratory purposes, being unfit for the manufacture
of Gunpowder, from the acid they contain, and the crystalline sulphur, after
being allowed to cool in the moulds, is barrelled up and used as the third ingredient
in Gunpowder.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>PULVERIZING THE INGREDIENTS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Grinding.</p>

<p>The three ingredients are now ground separately to a very fine powder. The
mills (vide <a href="#Plate1">plate 1</a>) which effect this, and incorporate, are so similar, that a description
will be given under the head of &#8220;Incorporation.&#8221;
<span class="sidenote">Screening.</span>After being ground in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
way, the saltpetre is passed through a slope cylindrical reel, covered with copper
sieving wire of 60 meshes to the inch, which, as it revolves, sifts it to the required
fineness, being then received in a box or bin underneath. The charcoal and sulphur
are likewise passed through similar reels of 32 and 60-mesh wire respectively, and
that which remains without passing through, is ground again under the runners. A
very excellent machine has been invented by Mr. Hall, the engineer, of Dartford, for
grinding charcoal, which makes a most useful addition to the Gunpowder factory. It
consists of a conical drum, working in a conical box, on the same principle as a
coffee-grinding machine, the axis being vertical. The mill is fed with charcoal by a
hopper, and, as it passes through in fine powder, falls into a revolving reel, which
sifts it in the same manner as before described, the whole being covered in, to prevent
the great annoyance of dust, which was felt until lately, from the old charcoal mill.
The three ingredients having been pulverized, are now fit for the mixing process.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>MIXING THE INGREDIENTS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Mixing and
proportions.</p>

<p>The ingredients are now weighed out very accurately, in the proportion of 75
nitre, 15 charcoal, and 10 sulphur, in 42lb. charges, viz., nitre, 31lbs. 8oz., charcoal,
6lbs. 4oz. 13drs., sulphur, 4lbs. 3oz. 3drs., and thoroughly mixed in a machine, which
consists of a cylindrical gun-metal or copper drum, about two feet in diameter, with
an axle passing through its centre, on which there are metal flyers, like forks. The
machinery is so arranged that the flyers and drum revolve in opposite directions when
in motion, at a rate of about one hundred revolutions per minute. Five minutes is
sufficient for a thorough mixture. The composition is then drawn off by a slip into
canvas bags the proper size to hold the 42lb. charges, which are tightly tied, and
taken to small magazines. <span class="sidenote">Green
charges.</span>These are called green charges, and are now ready for the
next process, incorporation.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>THE INCORPORATING MILL.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Incorporation.</p>

<p>The Incorporating Mill consists of an iron or stone circular flat bed, about seven
feet in diameter, fixed very firmly in the floor of the building which covers it, whereon
two iron or stone cylindrical runners, from five to seven feet in diameter, fourteen to
eighteen inches wide, and each weighing from 3 to 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tons, revolve. They have a
common axle, and a vertical shaft passing through the centre of the bed is connected
with this axle, and to machinery above or below, which communicates the motion.
These runners are not equidistant from the centre, by which arrangement in their
revolution every part of the composition on the bed is subjected to their action, which
is threefold, viz., crushing, grinding, and mixing; crushing, from the weight of the
cylinders; grinding, from the twisting motion which they are forced into from so
large a diameter revolving in so small a circle; and mixing, from a combination of
the two former motions. To prevent the powder from falling over the side of the
bed, a wooden rim, about two feet in height, is placed at an angle of forty-five
degrees with it, like the side of a funnel, and fitted closely all round its circumference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
This is called the &#8220;curb;&#8221; and in the centre of the bed a gun-metal ring, or
&#8220;cheese,&#8221; as it is termed, about two feet in diameter, and five inches high, concentric
with the bed, prevents the powder working beyond in that direction. Moreover,
two scrapers, or &#8220;ploughs,&#8221; connected by stays with the horizontal axle, revolve with
the runners, one rubbing against the inner, and the other the outer circle. These
ploughs are made of hard wood, shod with leather and felt, and their use is continually
to disturb and rout about the composition, and keep it under the path of the
runners, so that every part should get its share of incorporation. The houses or sheds
which cover these buildings have hitherto been constructed of wood, with either
corrugated iron or wooden roofing. The new incorporating mills in this factory,
which are just completed, are built with three sides of strong three-foot brickwork,
and the fourth side and roof of corrugated iron and glass. They are also placed in a
line contiguous to each other, the alternate ones only facing the same way, so that an
explosion from one would probably communicate no further, and the lighter parts of
the building would blow away, leaving the rest entire. Most of the machinery in the
factory is driven by water-wheels; the motive power of these mills is steam. A
horizontal shaft, worked by the engine, passes underneath the entire length of the
building in a cast-iron tank, and a bevel wheel on this shaft is geared into another one
on the vertical shaft under the centre of each bed, which, communicating with the
runners, gives the necessary motion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Water-tanks
to prevent
explosions.</p>

<p>In order, as much as possible, to guard against any explosion spreading, above
each bed, placed so as just to clear the runners, is suspended or balanced a copper
tank, holding about forty gallons of water. On one side of the tank is fixed a small
shaft, which communicates with similar cisterns over the beds of the mills on either
side. The other end of the tank rests on a flat board, which is subjected to a great
part of the force of an explosion. This consequently lifts, disengaging the support of
the tank, the contents of which drench the bed which has just exploded, thereby
putting out all fire, and cooling the machinery, besides having a similar effect on the
mills right and left, preventing, by this means, any extension of fire.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>INCORPORATING THE INGREDIENTS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Incorporation.</p>

<p>The charge is spread pretty evenly over the surface of the bed, and moistened
with from four to six pints of distilled water; the quantity varying according to the
state of the atmosphere; the runners are then set in motion, and run from seven to
eight revolutions per minute for three and a half hours, during which time the powder
is often routed up by a copper-shod spud, and watered slightly with a fine rose
watering pot, according to the experience of the millman; at the end of this time the
mixture is thoroughly incorporated, possesses all the chemical properties of Gunpowder,
and is taken off the bed in the form of a cake, varying from a quarter to
half an inch in thickness, and of a blackish-grey colour. <span class="sidenote">Mill cake.</span>This is called &#8220;Mill Cake,&#8221;
and when broken, the fracture should exhibit the same uniform appearance, without
presenting any sparkling or yellow specks; should this, however, be the case, it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
sign of the ingredients not being sufficiently incorporated. <span class="sidenote">Proof of mill
cake.</span>In this stage it undergoes
certain proofs; samples of the cake are taken from every charge that is worked, dried
in an oven, and granulated; half a drachm of this is fired in a vertical eprouvette,
which it ought to raise 3.5 inches; and half an ounce is flashed on a glass plate. If
very little residue or ash is left, it is an additional proof of its being well incorporated,
and that the millman has done his work properly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Importance of
incorporation.</p>

<p>Incorporation is by far the most important process in the manufacture of Gunpowder;
for, however carefully the other part of the fabrication is carried on, should
there be a failing in this, the powder will be worth nothing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Object of
manufacture.</p>

<p>The great and ultimate object to be attained in the manufacture of Gunpowder
is, to produce that which shall give equal results with equal charges; the greatest
regularity should therefore be observed in this stage. The millman should have great
experience; the runners and beds should be, as nearly as possible, the same size and
weight, and driven at the same speed throughout the factory; at any rate, each charge
should be worked to the same number of revolutions; the motion of the runners
should also be as uniform as possible, which is very satisfactorily accomplished by
each water-wheel being regulated by a governor.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>BREAKING DOWN THE MILL CAKE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Breaking
down the mill
cake.</p>

<p>The mill cake, after it comes off the bed of the incorporating mill, is placed in
wooden tubs, and taken to small-expense magazines, and from there, in about twelve
hours, to the breaking-down house; <span class="sidenote">Object of
mealing.</span>the object of the machine from which this takes
its name, is to reduce the cake to a convenient size for the hydraulic-press box, and
also that, by being crushed again to meal, it may get a more even pressure. It consists
of a strong gun-metal framework, in which are fixed two pairs of fine-toothed
or plain rollers, which revolve towards each other, working in spring collars, so that
on any hard substance getting in by mistake, they would open, and allow it to pass
through, thereby preventing the dangerous friction which would otherwise result. A
hopper, or upright wooden funnel, capable of holding about 500 lbs. is fixed at one
end of the machine, and an endless canvass band 2ft. 6in. wide, having strips of
leather sewn across at intervals of four inches, passes over one roller at the bottom of
the hopper, and one at the top of the machine. When set in motion, this conveys the
cake from the hopper to the highest point of the band; it then falls through the first
pair of rollers, and from thence through the second, passing in the form of meal into
small wooden carriages underneath, which, as they are filled, move forward by a self-acting
motion, making room for others. The mill cake thus broken down, is fit for
the press.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>PRESSING THE MEAL BY THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Hydraulic
Pressure.</p>

<p>The meal is now subjected to very powerful pressure; and, in order to explain
the way in which this is effected, a short description of the apparatus must be given.<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
The principle of the hydraulic press is so familiar to most, that it will be unnecessary
to do more than show how the power is applied (vide <a href="#Plate2">plate 2</a>).</p>

<p class="sidenote">Description of
box.</p>

<p>A very strong oak box, 2 feet 6 inches square, and 2 feet 9 inches deep, is constructed
so that two of the sides of the lid will fall back on hinges, or form a compact
solid box when screwed firmly together. Forty-six copper plates, 2 feet 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches
square, slide vertically into this box, and are kept five-eighths of an inch apart by
two metal slips with corresponding grooves, which can be removed when necessary.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Quantity
pressed.</p>

<p>About 800 lbs. of the meal is put into this box while the plates are in the position
we have described. When full, the slips are withdrawn, the plates being then
only separated by the powder between them: the lid is now firmly screwed down,
and the box turned over by an arrangement of pulleys, so that the plates which were
vertical will now be horizontal. The present upper side is then unscrewed, and a
travelling crane, moving on a rail overhead, is lowered till the claws attached
to it hook on to two trunnions fixed on the sides of the box; it is now hoisted by
means of a handwheel windlass, and the box being suspended, is pushed easily by
means of the rail, and deposited in this position on to the table of the ram under the
press block. <span class="sidenote">Amount of
pressure.</span>The pumps are now set in motion by a water-wheel, and are allowed
to work up to the required pressure, which is about seventy tons to the square foot;
it is then conveyed from under the block in the same manner, and very easily unloaded.
The press cake is then taken out in layers between each plate, resembling
dark pieces of slate, about half an inch in thickness. After a day or so, this hardens
so much as to be difficult to break, and the appearance of the fracture resembles that
of the finest earthenware. Many important advantages are gained by this pressure,
of which the following are the <span class="nowrap">principal:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Reasons for
pressure.</p>

<p>First, the density of the powder is increased, which prevents it falling to dust in
transport, or by rough usage. Secondly, its keeping qualities are improved, for it
withstands the action of the atmosphere, and absorbs less moisture than a porous
light powder. Thirdly, it produces more grain in the manufacture than mill cake;
and a less proportion, consequently, is lost in dust. Fourthly, a closer connection of
the ingredients is obtained. Fifthly, a greater volume of inflammable gas is produced
from a certain bulk, than from a corresponding bulk of lighter powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of pressure.</p>

<p>The range, however, is lessened, from a greater quantity being blown out of a gun
unignited; but this small loss is more than counterbalanced by the former advantages,
and actually it is only perceptible in newly-made powder; for a light, porous powder
soon loses its superior range from its absorption of moisture, while that of the dense
powder remains unaltered.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>GRANULATING THE PRESS CAKE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Mode of
granulation.</p>

<p>The next process is granulation, or reducing this press cake into the proper sized
grain for cannon, musket, or rifle powder. The machine which effects this is very
beautifully contrived, and is entirely self-acting, obviating the necessity of any one
being in the building while it is in motion. It resembles, in appearance and action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
the breaking-down machine, except that it is larger, and is fitted with three pairs of
toothed rollers, of different degrees of fineness, working in the same kind of collars
already mentioned, so that, on any hard substance passing through, they would open
accordingly, and thus prevent friction. At one end of the machine is a wooden
hopper, or funnel, which is filled with the press cake. This is contrived so as to rise
gradually by the motion of the machine, and constantly to supply an endless band,
similar to the one described in the breaking-down house. When the cake arrives at
the highest point of this band, it falls over, and is granulated between the first pair
of gun-metal rollers. <span class="sidenote">Screening.</span>Under each pair is a screen, covered with 8-mesh wire. All
that is not sufficiently small to pass through, is carried on to the next pair of rollers;
and, in like manner, that which does not pass through the second screen is carried to
the third pair. In addition to these screens, there are three oblong sieves covered
with 8- and 16-mesh wire, and 56 cloth respectively, fixed under, and parallel to,
each other, each being separated by about four inches of space, running at an incline
just below the three pairs of rollers; these all lead to little wooden carriages placed
on the opposite side of the machine, which are divided so as to collect the different
sized grain as it passes down. To facilitate the separation and sifting of the powder,
and to prevent masses of it forming and clogging up the wire, a shaking motion is
imparted by a circular wheel attached to the framework of these sieves revolving
against an octagonal one fixed to the machine. The grains which pass through each
screen below the rollers fall on the upper one of these three last-mentioned sieves.
That portion which passes through this, and is retained on the 16-mesh wire, is
cannon powder; that passing through the 16-mesh sieve, and retained on the
56-cloth, is fine grain; and a board, running also parallel underneath, retains the dust
that passes through the cloth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Chucks
regranulated.</p>

<p>The &#8220;chucks,&#8221; as they are called, or those grains that are too large to pass
through these different sieves, are collected in the same way as the grain, and
undergo the process of granulation again.</p>

<h3>DUSTING LARGE-GRAIN POWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Object of
dusting.</p>

<p>The keeping qualities of powder are very much improved by removing the dust,
which quickly absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. <span class="sidenote">How performed
for
large-grain.</span>This operation, for large-grain,
is performed by cylindrical reels, about 8ft. 6in. long, and 3ft. 8in. in diameter,
clothed with 28-mesh canvas, which revolve at the rate of thirty-eight times per
minute. Those for large-grain are called horizontal reels, in contradistinction to those
for fine-grain, that are called slope reels. Each is enclosed by a wooden case, to
prevent the dust flying about the house. When the powder has run its time, one
end of the reel is lowered. It then runs out into barrels placed to receive it. <span class="sidenote">Glazed at
same time.</span>This
entirely separates the dust, and imparts a fine black gloss, which is sufficient glazing
for the large-grained powder.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span></p>

<h3>DUSTING FINE-GRAIN POWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Dusting fine-grain.</p>

<p>The fine-grain powder has a much greater proportion of dust when it leaves the
granulating house than the large-grain, and it is found necessary, on this account, to
use a different kind of reel. They resemble those for the former powder, except that
they are covered with 44-mesh canvas instead of 28, and are placed at an incline
which prevents their being choked up with the quantity of dust; each end is also
open, and a continuous stream of powder, fed by a hopper, passes through while they
revolve, and pours out at the lower end into barrels. This process is repeated a second
time, which sufficiently frees it from dust.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>GLAZING FINE-GRAIN POWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Glazing fine-grain.</p>

<p>The fine-grain powder thus dusted, is then glazed for three hours in barrels
capable of holding 300lbs. which are 3ft. 6-in. in length, and 2ft. 8-in. in diameter,
revolving at the rate of thirty two times in a minute. By the mere friction of the
grains against each other and the inside of the barrel, a glaze is imparted, presenting
a fine polished surface to the grain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Object of
glazing.</p>

<p>Powder glazed in this way withstands the action of moisture to a far greater
extent than unglazed powder, and in transport very little dust is formed.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>STOVING OR DRYING POWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Drying.</p>

<p>A drying-room, heated by steam pipes, is fitted with open framework shelves, on
which rests small wooden trays about 3ft. long, 1ft. 6-in. in breadth, and 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>in. deep,
having canvas bottoms; on each is spread 8lbs. of powder. This room holds about
40 barrels, or 4,000lbs., which remains in it for twenty four hours, and is subjected to
a heat of 130&deg; Fahrenheit for sixteen hours, communicated by steam passing through
pipes arranged horizontally on the floor of the room. The temperature is raised and
lowered gradually, otherwise the too sudden change would be likely to destroy the
texture of the grain. The ceiling and roof are fitted with ventilators, through which
all the moisture escapes, so that there is a constant current of hot air circulating
through the room. It is of the greatest importance that the vapour should be carried
off; for, if this is not effectually done, on the decrease of temperature, it would return
to its liquid state, and form again on the powder.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>FINISHING DUSTING.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Final dusting.</p>

<p>The action of heat however produces a small portion of dust; both these powders,
therefore, when they leave the stove, are reeled in horizontal reels, clothed with 28
and 44-mesh canvas respectively, for one hour and a half. This perfectly separates
any remaining dust, and gives the finishing glaze to the large-grain powder. <span class="sidenote">Barrelling.</span>This is
the final process, and the powder thus finished is taken to the barrelling-up house;
weighed out into barrels holding 100lbs. each; marked L. G. (large-grain), and F. G.
(fine-grain), as the case may be; and stored in magazines.</p>

<h3>EXAMINATION AND PROOF OF GUNPOWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Desired
properties of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>The great and ultimate object to be attained in the manufacture of Gunpowder
is, not so much to produce that which ranges the highest, as one that shall be durable
in its texture, not easily deteriorated by atmospheric influence or transport, and one
with which equal charges shall produce equal effects. It should present uniformity
in the appearance of its grains, which should be angular, crisp and sharp to the touch,
not easily reduced to dust by pressure between the fingers, or dusty in handling; <span class="sidenote">Specific
gravity.</span>its
specific gravity should not be under 55lbs. to the cubic foot, (that of Waltham Abbey
is generally 58lbs.) taking water at 1000ozs.; <span class="sidenote">Strength.</span>its strength is tested by firing three
rounds from an 8 inch mortar, throwing a 68-pounder solid shot with a charge of 2oz.
this should give a range of from 270 to 300 feet. The distance however, varies
considerably, according to the state of the atmosphere, and the density of the powder:
for, the greater the density, the less the range in small charges. <span class="sidenote">Purity.</span>Half an ounce
flashed on a glass plate should leave little or no residuum; should white beads or
globules appear, it is a sign of imperfect incorporation.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>PROOF OF MERCHANT&#8217;S POWDER.</h3>

<p>The following are the different proofs merchant&#8217;s powder is subjected <span class="nowrap">to:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lots of 100 barrels are sent in, marked with the number of the lot and the
maker&#8217;s name on the head of each barrel. 25 per cent. of these are unheaded in the
examining house; the Proof Officer <span class="nowrap">then&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">If dusty.</p>

<p>First, takes a bowl out of each barrel, and holding it about three feet above,
pours it out quickly; should there be a good deal of dust, it is satisfactorily shown by
this means.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Firmness.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is handled and pressed between the fingers, to test the firmness of
its grain; <span class="sidenote">Size of grain.</span>and should there appear to be any great difference in the proportions of
different sizes to that laid down as a standard, it is sifted and compared accordingly,
being rejected should the quantities fall short or exceed the sample in any great
degree.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Density.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a barrel or two are selected, and the powder poured into a hopper,
under which is placed a box very carefully constructed, so as to hold exactly a cubic
foot. A slide is now withdrawn at the bottom of the hopper, and the powder allowed
to run into the box in a continuous even stream until it is piled up; the hopper is
then removed, and the powder struck off with a straight edge, level with the top of
the box. The weight is now carefully taken, that of the latter being subtracted;
should this not amount to 55lbs. it is rejected, as not being of sufficient density.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Strength by
range.</p>

<p>Fourthly, samples are taken from every barrel, and lot for the firing proof.</p>

<p>Firing Proof.&mdash;An average of nine rounds of sample Waltham Abbey powder is
taken, three rounds being respectively fired at the beginning, middle, and end of the
proof, from the same kind of mortar before mentioned, with a charge of 2oz. An
average of three rounds of each lot of the merchant&#8217;s powder is also taken; should it
fall short by more than 1 in 20, it is rejected.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Purity by
flashing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span></p>

<p>Fifthly, to ascertain if any residuum or ash is left after ignition, about half an
ounce is burned on a clean glass plate, and fired with a hot iron. The explosion
should be sharp, and produce a sudden concussion in the air; and the force and
power of this concussion should be judged by that of known good quality. Few
sparks should fly off, nor should white beads or globules appear, as it would be a sure
indication, as we have before explained, of insufficient incorporation. It is also subjected
to a second proof.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Purity by
weight after
exposure to
damp.</p>

<p>Second proof.&mdash;A sample of 1lb. from each lot, carefully weighed up, and a
similar sample of the comparison powder, is exposed for three weeks in a box perforated
with holes (called a damp chest), to the action of the atmosphere. This box
is placed under cover, so that it is sheltered from the wet, but that the moisture can
get to it. If, at the end of this time, there is a greater proportion of difference in
range between them than one-twentieth, it is rejected. The pounds are also very
carefully weighed up again, to ascertain the comparative absorption of moisture. This
is called the hygrometric test.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>REMARKS ON THE PROOF OF POWDER BY THE EPROUVETTES.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">By eprouvettes
or
pendulum.</p>

<p>By comparing the results of the proofs by the eprouvettes with those furnished
by the cannon pendulum (vide <a href="#Plate1">plate 1</a>, fig. 2 and 3), it will appear that the eprouvettes
are entirely useless as instruments for testing the relative projectile force of
different kinds of powder, when employed in large charges in a cannon. Powders of
little density, or of fine grain, which burn most rapidly, give the highest proof with
the eprouvettes, whilst the reverse is nearly true with the cannon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Real use of
eprouvettes.</p>

<p>The only real use of these eprouvettes is to check and verify the uniformity of a
current manufacture of powder, where a certain course of operations is intended to be
regularly pursued, and where the strength, tested by means of any instrument, should
therefore be uniform.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Best proof, by
service
charges.</p>

<p>The only reliable mode of proving the strength of Gunpowder is, to test it with
service charges in the arms for which it is designed; for which purpose the balistic
pendulums (vide <a href="#Plate3">plate 3</a>), are perfectly adapted.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Best proof for
small arms.</p>

<p>For the proof of powder for small arms, the small balistic pendulum is a simple,
convenient, and accurate instrument.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Common
eprouvette.</p>

<p>The common eprouvettes are of no value as instruments for determining the
relative force of different kinds of Gunpowder.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>OF THE SIZE OF GRAIN FOR GUNPOWDER.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">On size of
grain.</p>

<p>With regard to the particular size of grain for Gunpowder, I am confident great
improvements might be made, both in obtaining greater regularity of effect and propelling
force, by the adoption of a more uniform even grain. There are at present
half-a-dozen different sizes in our cannon and musket powder; and I think it stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
to reason, that the more equal the size, the more uniform will be the ignition of all
the grains, and consequently the effect of the same charges will be much more regular.</p>

<h4>PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION OF THE INGREDIENTS.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Production
and purification
of the
ingredients.</p>

<p>The nitre is purified in a similar way to the new method employed at Waltham
Abbey, though it is seldom obtained with so faint a trace of chlorides, owing probably
to its being of an inferior quality, and of higher refraction when it is imported.</p>

<p>The sulphur is supplied to the manufactories in France in the form of roll
sulphur, from Marseilles and Bordeaux, where there are very large refineries.</p>

<p>The charcoal is prepared from dogwood, alder, willow, hazel, and poplar, sometimes
in pits, and occasionally in cylinders, as at Waltham Abbey. At Wetteren,
and in some parts of France, it is distilled by the action of steam. The &#8220;charbon
roux&#8221; taking its name from its brownish-red tinge, from being only partially burned,
was used formerly more than now, as the powder made from it was found to injure
and exert very pernicious effects upon fire-arms.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>PULVERIZING AND MIXING THE INGREDIENTS.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Pulverizing
and mixing
the ingredients.</p>

<p>The ingredients are generally pulverized in copper drums, capable of holding
224 kilogrammes. Part of the charcoal is mixed with the sulphur, and part of the
sulphur with the saltpetre. They are then put into separate drums, which revolve
about twenty-five times per minute for three hours, and in which are about 500 gun-metal
or bronze balls, the size of good large marbles. The ingredients are brought
to the most minute state of division by these means, and are then mixed all together,
for one hour, in similar drums covered with leather, containing wooden balls.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<h4>INCORPORATING PROCESS.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Incorporation.</p>

<p>The fine powder thus obtained is sometimes merely moistened, so as to form a stiff
paste, and passed through rollers, the cake formed, being dried and granulated.
The incorporating cylinders are used occasionally, but the more usual plan adopted on
the Continent to effect this operation is the stamping-mill, which requires a short description.
It is nothing more nor less than the pestle-and-mortar principle, each mill
consisting of from six to twelve bronze or wooden mortars bedded in the floor of the
building; they are the shape of the frustum of a cone, the mouth being much
narrower than the base; the pestles, or stampers as they are called, are made of wood,
shod with either very hard wood or bronze, on which project wooden teeth about
twelve inches long; a vertical movement is imparted to them by a shaft worked by
the water-wheel having similar teeth attached; in its revolution it raises the stamper
about eighteen inches, which falls again as the projection is disengaged, twenty five
times in a minute. This operation is carried on for twelve hours, during which period
the charge (about 15lbs.) is moistened at intervals, and routed up with a copper-shod
spud; at the end of this time the cake is taken out, and left to dry and harden; it
seldom receives any pressure&mdash;although, in some manufactories, presses are being
erected.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>GRANULATING.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Granulation.</p>

<p>The cake is then granulated in sets of sieves fitting one into the other, having
perforated zinc bottoms of different degrees of fineness, which are suspended from the
ceiling of the room by ropes, an ash spring being attached to each box holding the
sieves, the cake is put into the uppermost one with some gun-metal balls, and shaken
backwards and forwards, which motion the spring facilitates; it is thus broken up into
different sized grains, which are separated by passing through the several meshes.</p>

<p>The grain formed is then dusted in bags or shaking-frames covered with canvas,
and then glazed in barrels.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>STOVING OR DRYING.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Drying.</p>

<p>In summer the process of drying is often performed in the sun, and in winter by
the steam stove, in the following way. The powder is spread about three or four
inches thick on a large canvas tray, under which is an arrangement of pipes, which
convey the hot air forced by a fan through a cylinder heated by steam: it is considered
to be sufficiently dried in from three to four hours, during which time it is
occasionally raked about. In some manufactories it undergoes a further operation of
being dusted, and is then barrelled up for use. Generally the great failure in the
foreign manufacture is the neglect of the principal stage of the fabrication, viz. incorporation;
with the old stamping-mill, it is quite impossible that the process can be
carried out to the necessary extent. <span class="sidenote">Comparative
merits of
foreign and
English gunpowder.</span>The Continental powder is usually very soft in<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
its grain, dusty, and quickly absorbs moisture from the atmosphere; its density is
below the English powder, on account of its never being subjected to pressure; consequently
it is not so durable, and forms a good deal of dust in transport; a great
amount of residue is generally left in the gun, and its strength, as a propelling agent,
is far inferior to our powders. On being flashed on a glass plate, instead of producing
a sudden concussion, like the sharp rap of a hammer, it burns more like composition,
throwing off a quantity of sparks.</p>

<h2>ON MAGAZINES.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p>It is impossible to make powder magazines too dry, and every care should be
taken to ventilate them as much as possible during dry weather, by opening all doors,
windows, loopholes, &amp;c. Magazines are generally made bomb-proof, and are
furnished with lightning conductors. They are divided into chambers, and these
again divided by uprights into bays. At Purfleet, which is the grand dep&ocirc;t for gunpowder
in England, there are five magazines capable of containing 9,600 whole barrels
each. Each magazine is divided into two chambers, and each chamber into 24 bays,
and in each bay is placed 200 whole, 400 half, or 800 quarter barrels of powder.
Total in the five Magazines, 48,000 barrels, equal to 4,800,000 pounds.</p>

<h2>LIGHTNING CONDUCTORS.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="note center"><i>Principles and Instructions relative to their application to Powder Magazines, by</i> <span class="smcap">Sir
W. Snow Harris</span>, F.R.S. <i>Extracted from Army List for July, 1859.</i></p>

<p class="blankbefore1">1.&mdash;Thunder and lightning result from the operation of a peculiar natural agency
through an interval of the atmosphere contained between the surface of a certain area
of clouds, and a corresponding area of the earth&#8217;s surface directly opposed to the
clouds. It is always to be remembered that the earth&#8217;s surface and the clouds are the
terminating planes of the action, and that buildings are only assailed by Lightning
because they are points, as it were, in, or form part of, the earth&#8217;s surface, in which
the whole action below finally vanishes. Hence buildings, under any circumstances,
will be always open to strokes of Lightning, and no human power can prevent it,
whether having Conductors or not, or whether having metals about them or not, as
experience shows.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Whenever the peculiar agency, (whatever it may be), active in this operation
of nature, and characterized by the general term Electricity, or Electric Fluid, is
confined to substances which are found to resist its progress, such, for example, as
air, glass, resinous bodies, dry wood, stones, &amp;c., then an explosive form of action
is the result, attended by such an evolution of light and heat, and by such an enormous
expansive force, that the most compact and massive bodies are rent in pieces,
and inflammable matter ignited. Nothing appears to stand against it. Granite rocks
are split open, oak and other trees, of enormous size, rent in shivers, and masonry
of every kind frequently laid in ruins. The lower masts of ships of the line, 3 feet in
diameter, and 110 feet long, bound with hoops of iron half an inch thick and 5 inches
wide, the whole weighing about 18 tons, have been, in many instances, torn asunder,
and the hoops of iron burst open and scattered on the decks. It is, in fact, this
terrible expansive power which we have to dread in cases of buildings struck by
Lightning, rather than the actual heat attendant on the discharge itself.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;When, however, the electrical agency is confined to bodies, such as the
metals, which are found to oppose but small resistance to its progress, then this violent
expansive or disruptive action is either greatly reduced, or avoided altogether. The
explosive form of action we term Lightning, vanishes, and becomes, as it were, transformed
into a sort of continuous current action, of a comparatively quiescent kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
which, if the metallic substance it traverses be of certain known dimensions, will not
be productive of any damage to the metal. If, however, it be of small capacity, as
in the case of a small wire, it may become heated and fused. In this case, the electrical
agency, as before, is so resisted in its course as to admit of its taking on a
greater or less degree of explosive and heating effect, as in the former case. It is to
be here observed, that all kinds of matter oppose some resistance to the progress of
what is termed the Electrical Discharge, but the resistance through capacious metallic
bodies is comparatively so small, as to admit of being neglected under ordinary circumstances;
hence it is that such bodies have been termed Conductors of Electricity,
whilst bodies such as air, glass, &amp;c., which are found to oppose very considerable
resistance to electrical action, are placed at the opposite extremity of the scale, and
termed Non-conductors or Insulators.</p>

<p>The resistance of a metallic copper wire to an ordinary electrical discharge from
a battery, was found so small, that the shock traversed the wire at the rate of 576,000
miles in a second. The resistance however, through a metallic line of Conduction, small
as it be, increases with the length, and diminishes with the area of the section of the
Conductor, or as the quantity of metal increases.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;It follows from these established facts, that if a building were metallic in all
its parts, an iron magazine for example, then no damage could possibly arise to it
from any stroke of Lightning which has come within the experience of mankind; e.g.,
a man in armour is safe from damage by Lightning; in fact, from the instant the
electrical discharge in breaking with disruptive and explosive violence through the
resisting air, seizes upon the mass in any point of it, from that instant the explosive
action vanishes, and the forces in operation are neutralized upon the terminating planes
of action, viz., the surface of the earth, and opposed clouds.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;All this plainly teaches us, that in order to guard a building effectually
against damage by Lightning, we must endeavour to bring the general structure as
nearly as may be, into that passive or non-resisting state it would assume, supposing
the whole were a mass of metal.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;To this end, one or more conducting channels of copper depending upon
the magnitude and extent of the building should be systematically applied to the walls;
these conducting channels should consist either of double copper plates united in series
one over the other, as in the method of fixing such Conductors to the masts of Her
Majesty&#8217;s Ships, the plates being not less than 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches wide, and of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>th and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>th of
an inch in thickness, or the Conductors may with advantage be constructed of stout
copper pipe not less than <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch thick, and
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 inches in diameter: in
either case the Conductors should be securely fixed to the walls of the building, either
by braces, or copper nails, or clamps; they should terminate in solid metal rods above,
projecting freely into the air, at a moderate and convenient height above the point to
which they are fixed, and below they should terminate in one or two branches leading
outward about a foot under the surface of the earth; if possible, they should be connected
with a spring of water or other moist ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span></p>

<p>It would be proper in certain dry situations, to lead out in several directions
under the ground, old iron or other metallic chains, so as to expose a large extent of
metallic contact in the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;All the metals in the roof and other parts of the building of whatever kind,
should so far as possible have metallic communication with these Alarm Conductors,
and in case of any prominent elevated chimney, it would be desirable to lead a pointed
conducting tube along it to the metals of the roof; all of which satisfies the conditions
above specified.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Remark 1.&mdash;It is now proved beyond all questions, that the electrical
discharge never leaves perfect conducting lines of small resistance, in order to pass out
upon bad conducting circuits, in which the resistance is very great, that is an established
law of nature; hence a stroke of Lightning upon such conducting lines will be
confined to the Conductors as constituting a line of discharge of less resistance than
any other line of discharge through the building, which can be assigned. The
apprehension of &#8220;Lateral Discharge&#8221; therefore, from the Conductor, is quite absurd;
and is not countenanced by any fact whatever; if any doubt could possibly exist, it would
be now most completely set at rest by the experience of the permanent Conductors,
applied to the masts of Her Majesty&#8217;s ships. In very many instances furious discharges
of Lightning have fallen on the masts with a crash as if the ship&#8217;s broadside
had been fired, and the solid point aloft has been found melted; in all these cases
electrical discharge robbed by the Conductor of its explosive violence, has traversed
the line of action to the sea, through the ship, and through the copper bolts, driven
through the ship&#8217;s solid timbers, without the least damage to the surrounding masses,
whether metallic, as in the case of the massive iron hoops on the lower masts, or not.
Persons have either been close by or actually leaning against the Conductors at the
time, without experiencing any ill consequence.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Remark 2.&mdash;It has also been incontestably shown, that metallic bodies have
not any specific attractive force or affinity for the matter of Lightning; metals are as
little attractive of lightning as wood or stone. All matter is equally indifferent to
Electricity so far as regards a specific attraction, hence the idea that metals attract or
invite Lightning is a popular but very unlearned error contradicted by the most satisfactory
evidence, and the whole course of experience; in short, we find that Lightning
falls indiscriminately upon trees, rocks, and buildings, whether the buildings have
metals about them or not.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Remark 3.&mdash;A building that is hence clear, may be struck and damaged by
Lightning without having a particle of metal in its construction; if there be metals in
it, however, and they happen to be in such situations as will enable them to facilitate
the progress of the electrical discharge, so far as they go, then the discharge will fall
on them in preference to other bodies offering more resistance, but not otherwise; if
metallic substances be not present, or if present, they happen to occupy places in which
they cannot be of any use in helping on the discharge in the course it wants to go, then
the electricity seizes upon other bodies, which lie in that course, or which can help it,
however small their power of doing so, and in this attempt such bodies are commonly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
but not always, shattered in pieces. The great law of the discharge is,&mdash;progress
between the terminating planes of action, viz:&mdash;the clouds and earth, and in such line
or lines as upon the whole, offer the least mechanical impediment or resistance to this
operation, just as water falling over the side of a hill in a rain storm, picks out or
selects as it were by the force of gravity, all the little furrows or channels which lie
convenient to its course, and avoids those which do not. If in the case of Lightning
you provide through the instrumentality of efficient Conductors, a free and uninterrupted
course for the electrical discharge, then it will follow that course without
damage to the general structure; if you do not, then this irresistible agency will find
a course for itself through the edifice in some line or lines of least resistance to it, and
will shake all imperfect conducting matter in pieces in doing so; moreover it is to be
specially remarked in this case, that the damage ensues, not where the metals are, but
where they cease to be continued, the more metal in a building therefore the better,
more especially when connected by an uninterrupted circuit with any medium of communication
with the earth.</p>

<p>Such is, in fact, the great condition to be satisfied in the application of Lightning
Conductors, which is virtually nothing more than the perfecting a line or lines of small
resistance in given directions, less than the resistance in any other lines in the building,
which can be assigned in any other direction, and in which by a law of nature the
electrical agency will move in preference to any others.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;It follows from the foregoing principles, that a magazine constructed entirely
of iron or other metal, would be infinitely more safe in Lightning storms than if built
with masonry in the usual way; metallic roofs for magazines, with capacious metallic
Conductors to the earth, would be unobjectionable, and a source of security.</p>

<p>Metallic gutters and ridges having continuous metallic connection with the earth
are also unobjectionable.</p>

<p>A good method of Conductors for magazines built of masonry, would be such as
already described, regard being had to the position of the building, its extent, and
most prominent points, also to the nature, state, and condition of the soil, whether it
be moist or dry, alluvial calcareous, or of hard rock; we must also consider the extent,
disposition, and peculiar position of the metallic bodies entering into the general
structure of the building, whether the roof be flat, pointed, or angular in various parts.</p>

<p>The pointed projecting extremities of the two Conductors, one or more as the
case may be, will be commonly sufficient; but, in buildings having tall chimneys or
other elevated prominent points, at a distance from the Main Conductor, it will be
requisite to guard such chimneys or other parts, by a pointed rod, led along them to
the metals of the roof, or directly connected with the Main Conductors, by metallic
connections.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;Pointed terminations of the Conductors in the air, are so far important that
they tend to break the force of a discharge of Lightning when it falls on them. In
fact, before the great shock actually takes place, under the form of a dense explosion,
a very large amount of the discharge, which otherwise would be concentrated, runs off,
as it were, through the pointed Conductor; but they have no other influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span></p>

<p>With respect to these pointed terminations, no great care need be taken about
them, except that they should consist of solid copper rod, of about three-quarters of an
inch in diameter, and about a foot in length, and be united by brazing to the conducting
tube, elevated at such convenient height above the walls of the building as the
case may suggest.</p>

<p>As a support to the Conductor, when raised above the wall, we may employ a
small staff or spar of wood fixed to the masonry.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;Copper linings to the doors and window shutters of magazines are not
objectionable, if requisite, as a precaution against fire; but they are useless as a means
of keeping out Lightning; on the other hand, it is not easy to conceive a case in which
the explosion of the gunpowder is to be apprehended from the action of Lightning on
the doors or windows. Supposing, however, such metallic linings desirable as a precaution
against common cases of fire, then the masses of metal should, according to the
principles already laid down, have metallic communication with the general system of
conduction in the building and the Main Conductor.</p>

<h2>ON THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF
GUNPOWDER.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">Advantages
of Gunpowder</p>

<p>The advantages of Gunpowder, as a propelling agent, over any other explosive
material are, the comparative safety attending its manufacture and transport, and the
gradual nature of its decomposition when compared with those materials, such as fulminating
gold, silver, mercury, &amp;c. &amp;c. In gunpowder, the force resulting from the
rapid evolution of gas in a confined space has sufficient time to overcome the inertia of
the projectile, which is not the case with other explosive materials, the conversion of
which gaseous products is so instantaneous that nothing can resist the intensity of their
explosive action. Other advantages suggest themselves in the use of Gunpowder, such
as the comparative cheapness of the ingredients composing it, and the ease with which
they may be obtained; for the sulphur and saltpetre are very abundant productions of
nature, and the charcoal can be manufactured cheaply and with great facility, and if
care is taken in the process of the fabrication of powder, little deterioration will take
place on its exposure to heat or moisture.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Air &amp; Steam
as propellants</p>

<p>Condensed air and steam have been used as propelling agents; but the great
inconvenience attending their use quite preclude the possibility of adapting them to
war purposes.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Force of Gunpowder.</p>

<p>As the force and effect obtained from Gunpowder is the foundation of all other
particulars relating to Gunnery, we will briefly consider these points.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Upon what
the action of
powder depends.</p>

<p>The action of Gunpowder is dependent upon a purely chemical process. Mr.
Robins proved that the force generated by the combustion of gunpowder, was owing
to an elastic gas which was suddenly disengaged from the powder, when it was brought
to a certain temperature, and further that this disengaged gas had its elastic force
greatly augmented by the heat evolved by the chemical action.</p>


<p class="sidenote">Ingredients
are charged
with a large
volume of
heated gas.</p>

<p>The propelling power of Gunpowder is dependent on the rapid decomposition of
the nitre into its component parts; the oxygen forms carbonic acid with the carbon in
the charcoal, and the heat thus generated by ignition changes both this and the nitrogen
into a large volume of heated gas. In a mixture of nitre and charcoal alone, the
oxidation proceeds with comparative slowness; by the addition of sulphur, an augmentation
of combustibility is gained, in consequence of its igniting at a very low
temperature; the sulphur, also, by its presence, renders available for the oxidation of
the carbon an additional amount of oxygen, viz: that which is united with the potassium,
the latter being at once converted into sulphite upon ignition of the powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Weight of gas
evolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span></p>

<p>It appears that the weight of gas generated is equal to three tenths of the weight
of the powder which yielded it, <span class="sidenote">Volume of gas
evolved.</span>and that its bulk when cold, and expanded to the
rarity of Common air was 240 times that of the powder; the barometer standing at
about 30 inches. From this Robins concluded that if the fluid occupied a space equal
to the volume of the gunpowder, its elastic force, when cold, would be 240 times the
pressure of the atmosphere, when the barometer stands as above. <span class="sidenote">Heat of gas
evolved.</span>Mr. Robins also
considered that the heat evolved was at least equal to that of red hot iron, and he
found by experiments that air heated to this temperature had its elasticity quadrupled,
and therefore, that the force of gas from powder is at least four times 240 = 960, or in
round numbers 1,000 times as great as the elasticity of the air measured by its pressure
on an equal extent of surface. <span class="sidenote">Pressure of
gas generated.</span>From the height of the barometer it is known that the
pressure of the atmosphere is about 14<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>lbs. upon the square inch, so that the pressure
of the elastic gas generated by the combustion of the gunpowder upon the same area
would be 14.75 by 1,000 or 14,750lbs. at the moment of explosion. <span class="sidenote">Strength of
powder not
affected by
density of air,
but by damp.</span>He found that
the strength of Gunpowder was the same whatever might be the density of the atmosphere,
but that the moisture of the air effected it considerably, in fact that the same
quantity of powder which would give a bullet an initial velocity of 1,700 feet per
second on a day when the atmosphere was comparatively dry, would upon a damp
day give no more than 1,200 or 1,300 feet.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Velocity of gas</p>

<p>The velocity of the expansion of the gas is a most important point, upon which
depends, chiefly, the peculiar value of the substance as a propelling agent. Many of
the warlike machines of the Ancients produced a momentum far surpassing that of
our heaviest cannon, but the great celerity given to the bodies projected from guns by
gunpowder cannot be in the least approached by any other means than by the sudden
production of an elastic gas. Mr. Robins found that the flame of gunpowder expanded
itself when at the muzzle of the gun with a velocity of 7,000 feet per second.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dr. Hutton&#8217;s
calculation as
to:&mdash;<i>Volume,
Temperature,
Pressure</i>.</p>

<p>It has been calculated that one cubic inch of powder is converted into 250 cubic
inches of gas at the temperature of the atmosphere, and Dr. Hutton states that the
increase of volume at the moment of ignition cannot be less than eight times; therefore
one inch of gunpowder, if confined, at the time of explosion exerts a pressure of about
30,000lbs. being 250 by 8 by 15 = 30,000lbs. on the cubic inch, or 5,000lbs. on the
square inch; and which at once accounts for its extraordinary power. <span class="sidenote">Temperature</span>The value of
the temperature to which the gases are raised, on the explosion of the powder, has been
variously estimated and it may be concluded to rise as high as will melt copper, or
4,000&deg; Fahrenheit. <span class="sidenote">Expansion.</span>All gases expand uniformly by heat, the expansion having been
calculated with great precision, to be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>480</sub>th for each degree of Fahrenheit. If therefore
we take Dr. Hutton&#8217;s calculations of one volume of powder expanding into 250
volumes of gas at the temperature of the atmosphere, and if we suppose 4,000&deg; Fahrenheit
to be the heat to which they are raised on ignition, the expansion of
gunpowder would be calculated. <span class="sidenote">How to calculate
expansion</span>Thus, suppose the gas to be at 60&deg;, the temperature
of the atmosphere, we must deduct 60&deg; from 4,000&deg;, which will give
3,940, being the number of degrees remaining to which it is raised, hence

<span class="horsplit"><span class="top fsize80">vol.</span><span class="bot">8&middot;2</span></span>
that is, each volume of gas would at a temperature of 4000&deg; be<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
increased 8&middot;2 in volume. Gunpowder when at the temperature of the air being expanded
250 times in volume; therefore 250 by 8&middot;2 = 2,050 as the increased
expansion for each volume of gas generated by the explosion of gunpowder at the
temperature of 4,000&deg; Fahrenheit. Lieut-Colonel Boxer calculates that the heat
generated by good dry powder is not under 3,000&deg; Fahrenheit. <span class="sidenote">Absolute
force of gunpowder
cannot
be determined.</span>It appears with our
present knowledge, the absolute value of the force of gunpowder cannot be determined.
Still by careful and extensive experiments no doubt a near approximation to the truth
may ultimately be arrived at, so that although much has already been done by various
eminent philosophers, there is still more to be accomplished; and the importance of
the subject ought to act as a stimulus to the exertions of those belonging to a profession
the most interested in the question.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Loss of velocity
by windage.</p>

<p>It has been found by experiments that in calculating the initial velocity of a projectile,
one third of the whole force was lost with a windage of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub>th inch with a shot
of 1&middot;96-in. and 1&middot;86-in. in diameter. The bore of the gun being 2&middot;02-in.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Definition of
ignition and
combustion.</p>

<p>By ignition we understand the act of setting fire to a single grain, or to a charge of
gunpowder, and by combustion we mean the entire consumption of a grain or of a charge.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Quickness of
combustion.</p>

<p>Upon the quickness of combustion mainly depends the applicability of gunpowder
for Military purposes.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ignition by
heat.</p>

<p>Gunpowder may be inflamed in a variety of ways, but whatever be the method,
one portion of the substance must in the first instance be raised to a temperature a
little above that necessary to sublime the sulphur, which can be removed from the
other ingredients, by gradually raising the compound to a heat sufficient to drive it off
in a state of vapour. The heat required for this purpose is between 600&deg; and 680&deg;
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Progressive
combustion.</p>

<p>When a charge of powder is exploded in the bore of a gun, to all appearance
there would seem to be an instantaneous generation of the whole force. But in fact
it is not so, a certain time being necessary to the complete combustion of the substance.
This gradual firing is of the utmost importance, for were it otherwise, the gun, unless
of enormous strength, must be shattered in pieces, as well as the projectile; for in such
a case, this great force being suddenly exerted upon one part only of the material,
there would not be time for the action to be distributed over the particles, at any great
distance, before those in the immediate vicinity of the explosion, were forced out of
the sphere of action of the cohesive force, and consequently rupture must take place.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Substances
which have
a more violent
action than
powder.</p>

<p>The effect of such an action may be observed by exploding detonating powders,
in which are contained chlorate of potash or fulminating mercury. The action of that
peculiar substance the chlorite of nitrogen is still more remarkable. There is also
another compound, containing three parts of saltpetre, one part of carbonate of potash
and one part of sulphur, which when brought to a certain heat will explode with great
violence, its destructive force being very considerable; and this is principally due to
the rapidity of the evolution of the gas, for its amount is less than that produced from
gunpowder, but the complete decomposition occurs in a much shorter time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">In a damp
state less
quickly fired,
and why.</p>

<p>If gunpowder be in a damp state, the velocity of combustion will be less than
when dry, and also a longer time will be necessary to ignite it, since the moisture<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
upon its conversion into vapour, absorbs a certain amount of heat which remains latent,
and of which the useful effects so far as igniting the powder is concerned, is entirely
lost.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ignition by
percussion.</p>

<p>Gunpowder may be ignited by the percussion of copper against copper, copper
against iron, lead against lead, and even with lead against wood, when the shock is
very great. It is more difficult to ignite gunpowder between copper and
bronze,<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
or bronze and wood than between the other substances. Again, out of ten
samples which were wrapt in paper and struck upon an anvil with a heavy hammer,
seven of grained powder exploded and nine of mealed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Bronze consists of 78 parts copper to 20 of tin. Bell metal&mdash;78 copper and 22 tin. Gun metal&mdash;100 copper
to 8 to 10 tin. Brass&mdash;2 copper, 1 zinc and calamine stone, to harden and colour.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="sidenote">Influence of
shape of grain
on ignition.</p>

<p>If the part to which the heat is applied be of an angular shape, the inflammation
will take place quicker than if it be of a round or flat form, on account of the greater
surface that is exposed to the increased temperature.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The form of
the grain influences
the
velocity of the
transmission
of flame.</p>

<p>If the grains are of a rounded form, there would be larger interstices, and a
greater facility will be afforded to the passage of the heated gas, and therefore this
shape is most favourable to the rapid and complete inflammation of each grain in the
whole charge. On the other hand, particles of an angular or flat form, fitting into
each other as it were, offer greater obstruction to this motion, and the velocity of the
transmission of inflammation is thereby diminished.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of size
on the velocity
of transmission
of inflammation.</p>

<p>If the grains be small, the interstices will be small also, and the facility to the
expansion of the gas thereby diminished. In the experiments with trains of powder,
the increased surface exposed to the heated gas was found to more than compensate for
the diminished facility to its expansion, and generally a train of small-grained powder
laid upon a surface without being enclosed, will be consumed more quickly than a train
of large-grained powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Large grain
best suited for
heavy ordnance.</p>

<p>But this is not the case in a piece of ordnance, a circumstance which amongst
others will account for the diminished initial velocity given to the shot by a charge of
small-grained musket powder, below that produced by the large-grained usually
adopted for this service.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Velocity of the
transmission
of inflammation
of the
charge.</p>

<p>When a number of grains of powder are placed together as in the charge of a
gun, and a few of them are ignited at one end of the cartridge, a certain quantity of gas
is developed of a temperature sufficiently high to ignite those in their immediate
vicinity. This has also such elasticity as to enable it to expand itself with considerable
velocity. Again, the grains which are so ignited continue the inflammation to others in
the same manner. The absolute velocity of expansion of this gas is very considerable;
but the grains of gunpowder in the charge offer an obstruction to this motion, the gas
having to wind its way through the interstices, and consequently the velocity is considerably
diminished, but it is quite clear that it must be very much greater than the
velocity of combustion. <span class="sidenote">Estimate of
Mr. Piobert.</span>Mr. Piobert estimates the velocity of transmission of inflammation
of a charge in a gun at about 38 feet per second, and in all probability even this
is much under the mark.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Experiments
made on this
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span></p>

<p>Many experiments have been made by observing the velocity of transmission of
inflammation of trains of powder under various circumstances, but they do not show us
what would be the velocity in a confined charge. The velocity increased with the
section of the train, and further when at the end first lighted, there was an obstruction
to the escape of gas, as in the case of a gun, a much shorter time was required for complete
inflammation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Time of decomposition
depends upon
form of grain.</p>

<p>When the charge of powder in a gun is ignited the grains being enveloped by the
heated gas, we may consider that each grain is ignited over its whole surface at once.
If the grains of powder were of equal or regular form, the time each would be consuming,
might be easily calculated, but since in ordinary cases they are irregular in
form, although the grains may be of the same weight, the time necessary for their
complete decomposition will be very different.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Circumstances
affecting
combustion.</p>

<p>The quickness of combustion will depend upon the dryness of the powder, the
density of the composition, the proportion of the ingredients, the mode of manufacture,
and the quality of the ingredients.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Combustion
of cubical
grains considered.</p>

<p>Were a cubical grain to be ignited upon its whole surface, the decomposition may
be supposed to take place gradually from the surface to the centre, and the original
cubical form to remain until the whole is consumed, the cube becoming smaller and
smaller. If, then, the rate of burning be the same throughout, the quantity of gas
generated in the first half portion of the time will evidently be considerably more than
in the latter half, as in the latter case there will be a much lesser surface under the
influence of flame.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elongated
and cylindrical
grains.</p>

<p>If the form of the grain be elongated, then will the quantity of gas generated in
a given time from a grain of similar weight to that of the cube or sphere, be increased,
on account of the greater ignited surface, and consequently the time necessary for its
combustion will be diminished. If it be of a cylindrical form for example, this time
must be reckoned from the diameter of the cylinder, its length not influencing it in the
least, although as we have seen, it enters into the consideration of the quantity of the
gas generated in a given time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Large grain.</p>

<p>In the ordinary large-grain powder, the majority of the grains are of the elongated
or flat form, from whence considerable advantage is derived, particularly in short guns,
since it causes the greatest portion of the charge to be decomposed before the projectile
is moved sensibly from its original position.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mealed powder.</p>

<p>If the charge be composed of mealed powder a longer time is found to be
necessary for the complete combustion of the whole than in the case where the substance
is granulated, and the initial velocity of a shot is reduced about one third by
employing the substance in that state.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The effect of
granulating
gunpowder.</p>

<p>A piece of pressed cake weighing 1&middot;06oz., was put into a mortar, and a globe of
some light substance, placed upon it, and the powder being consumed after ignition
without ejecting the ball from the bore of the piece. When an equal quantity was
divided into seven or eight pieces, the globe was thrown out of the mortar; breaking
the cake into twelve pieces; the ball ranged 3&middot;3 yards; being further increased to fifty
grains, it ranged 10&middot;77 yards; and when the ordinary powder was used, the ball was
projected 56&middot;86 yards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Action depends
upon
size and form
of grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span></p>

<p>It will appear from the above remarks, that the force generated from the charge
of powder in a gun, will be greatly influenced by the size and form of the grains
composing it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Density of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a gunpowder which shall possess a proper amount of force, it
is necessary that the ingredients should be thoroughly incorporated, and the process
of incorporation will in great measure affect the density of the grains. After going
through the process, it is subjected to a certain pressure, in order that the substance
in travelling may not be reduced to a fine powder, which would cause the velocity of
transmission of inflammation to be diminished. But there is a certain point beyond
which it would not be advantageous to increase the density, and this seems to vary
with the size of the grain. With large-grain powder the action in a musket, or in
guns with small charges, is greatest with a low density; while with very small grain,
the highest velocities are obtained generally with the gunpowder of great density; but
in heavy guns with ordinary charges, the large-grained powder should be of considerable
density in order to obtain the greatest effect, though still it must not be too
great.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages
of glazing.</p>

<p>The principal advantages of glazing are; first, that the powder so prepared, will in
travelling, owing to the smaller amount of destructive force consequent on friction,
produce less mealed powder; and secondly, that in a damp country like England,
the glazing imparts a preserving power to the powder, as the polished surface is less
likely to imbibe moisture than the rough.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of glazing.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of glazing consists in its polishing the surface, and thus depriving
it of those angular projections which cause the ignition and combustion to be
carried on with greater rapidity, by rendering the interstices smaller, the consequence
of which is, that there is not so much gas produced previously to the projectile leaving
the gun, and in large charges a portion will be blown out unfired. There must be a
limit then to glazing, which it would not be proper to exceed. <span class="sidenote">Experiments
as to glazing.</span>At an experiment
with glazed and unglazed powder, the ranges on the eprouvette were 75 for glazed,
and 98 for unglazed. This loss of power, consequent on glazing, has caused it to be
done away with in France and Russia. <span class="sidenote">Glazing less
hurtful to fine
grains.</span>With fine grain powder it is not of so much
consequence, as it is, to a certain degree, corrected by the size of the grain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Size of grain
determined
by size of
charge.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which a charge of gunpowder is consumed will depend not
only in a certain degree upon the size of the grain, but on the manner in which the
charge is put together, for if a charge is closely pressed, the gases meeting resistance
in their endeavours to escape between the interstices, will not propagate the ignition
so rapidly. With large charges, there exists a positive advantage for the grains to be
rather large, so that the most distant parts of the charge should be reached by the
gases as quickly as possible; whilst with that of a rifle, the charge being small, the
fineness of the grain does not interfere with the quantity of the gas developed.
Whence it may rationally be concluded that the dimensions of the grains should
increase in proportion to the quantity of the charges into which they are to enter, that
is to say, in proportion to the interstices. <span class="sidenote">Tight ramming
bad.</span>Ramming down a charge tightly must
therefore interfere with the velocity of combustion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Produce of
decomposed
gunpowder.</p>

<p>The produce obtained by the decomposition of gunpowder are the gaseous and
the solid. The gaseous is chiefly nitrogen and carbonic acid. The solid is sulphur
and potassium, mixed with a little charcoal, but the solid produce is nearly entirely
volatilized at the moment of explosion through the high temperature.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fouling.</p>

<p>Fouling is occasioned by the deposition inside the barrel of the solid residue
proceeding from the combustion of the powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Conditions of
fouling depend
on state
of atmosphere</p>

<p>One of the principal of these, namely, the sulphide of Potassa, is deliquescent,
or attracts water from the atmosphere. Hence, on a clear day, when the air holds
little moisture, the fouling does not attain that semi-fluid state it so speedily attains in
a damp day, and it is not so easily removed, and tends to accumulate inside the
barrel. Fouling may also be increased or diminished, according to the quality of the
powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effects of
Fouling.</p>

<p>Fouling occasions loss of power from the increased friction, and causes inaccuracy
in direction and elevation, by filling the grooves, and thus preventing the proper spiral
motion being imparted to the projectile.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF GUNPOWDER ON METALS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Difference of
effect on brass
and iron guns.</p>

<p>The effect produced by Gunpowder on metals, in long continued and rapid
firing, is very extraordinary. Several of the guns employed at the siege of San
Sebastian were cut open, and the interior of some of the vent holes, which were originally
cylindrical, and only two-tenths of an inch in diameter, were enlarged in a
curious and irregular manner, from three to five inches in one direction, and from two
to three inches in another, but the brass guns were much more affected than the iron.
In December, 1855, there were lying in the arsenal at Woolwich several of the
heaviest sea mortars, which had recently been used at the bombardment of Sweaborg,
and the continuous firing on that occasion had split them into two nearly equal portions
from muzzle to breech, a trunnion being with each half.</p>

<p>Heavy guns for garrisons, sieges, &amp;c., are made of cast iron; guns for field
purposes, where lightness is required, are made of gun metal.</p>


<p class="sidenote">Difference of
effect of brass
and iron guns</p>

<p>These guns are generally denominated brass guns. They can be loaded, properly
pointed at an object, and fired about four times in three minutes, but they will not
stand long continued rapid firing, or more than 120 rounds a day, as the metal, when
heated, softens, and the shot then injures the bore. Heavy iron guns may be loaded,
fired, &amp;c., once in two minutes. They suffer more from the total number of rounds
that have been fired from them, without reference to the intervals between each
round, than from the rapidity of the firing. Four hundred and five hundred rounds
per day have not rendered an iron gun unserviceable.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>The following experiments, extracted from Mr. Wilkinson&#8217;s &#8220;Engines of War,&#8221;
serve to illustrate the capability of metals to resist the force of gunpowder, and may
be of some practical utility, as well as prove interesting merely as matter of curiosity.</p>

<p>Experiment 1.&mdash;A piece about 5 inches long was cut off the breech-end of a
common musket barrel. It was screwed at the part cut, and another plug fitted, so
as to have two plugs, one at each end, leaving an internal space of about 3 inches. A
percussion nipple was screwed into the end of one of these plugs. This being arranged,
one of the plugs was turned out, and one drachm of gunpowder introduced. The
plug was replaced, and the powder fired by putting a copper cap on the nipple, and
striking it with a hammer. The whole force of the powder escaped at the hole in the
nipple. Two, three, four, five, and six drachms were successively introduced, and
fired in the same manner, without bursting or injuring the piece of barrel. At last,
seven drachms forced out one end, in consequence of the screw having been carelessly
fitted. This defect being repaired, Mr. Marsh, of Woolwich, repeatedly fired it with
five drachms, merely holding it with a towel in his left hand, and firing it with a blow
of a hammer. Six drachms of powder is the full service charge for a flint musket,
and four drachms of a percussion musket; yet this immense pressure can be resisted
by a cylinder of iron not more than one quarter of an inch thick, and not iron of the
best quality.</p>

<p>Experiment 2.&mdash;A good musket barrel had a cylinder of brass, three inches long,
turned to fit the muzzle, and soldered in, so as to close it air-tight. The plug, or
breech-screw, was removed, and a felt wad was pushed in with a short piece of wood,
marked to the exact depth the charge would occupy, to prevent the ball rolling forward.
A musket ball was then dropped in, and a cartridge, containing three drachms
of powder, was introduced. The breech being screwed in, left the barrel loaded. It
was fired by a percussion tube, but there was no report. On removing the breech-screw,
the ball was found to be flattened. A repetition of this experiment, with four
drachms, produced a similar result, but the ball was rather more flattened. With five
drachms, the ball was perfectly round and uninjured. Six drachms burst the barrel
close under the bayonet stud; the ball escaped through the opening, disfigured, but
fell close to the barrel. In these experiments the barrel always advanced, instead of
recoiling, as usual.</p>

<p>Experiment 3.&mdash;Made at Woolwich Arsenal, with a Gomer mortar, the chamber being
bored conically, so that the shell, when dropped in, fits closely all round,
instead of being bored cylindrically, with a chamber in the centre. The mortar being
laid at an angle of 45&deg;, one drachm of powder was put into the bottom, and a
68-pounder iron shot over it. When fired, the ball was projected two feet clear of
the mortar. A wooden ball, precisely the same diameter, but weighing only 5lbs.,
was scarcely moved by the same charge, and with two drachms of powder it was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
lifted in the mortar, and fell into its place again. Here we find a weight of 68lbs.
thrown to the distance of two feet by the same power which would not lift 5lbs., and
the wooden ball scarcely moved by double the powder.</p>

<p>This proves that the firing of gunpowder under such circumstances is not instantaneous.
In the first instance, the small quantity of powder had a large space to
fill below the ball, and a heavy weight to move; therefore, could not stir it at all until
the whole was ignited, when the force was sufficient to throw it forward two feet.
In the second case, the first portion of gas that was generated by ignition of the
powder, was sufficient to lift the lighter weight, just enough to allow all the force to
escape round it before it had time to accumulate.</p>

<p>Experiment 4.&mdash;A cannon ball, weighing 24lbs., was placed exactly over the
vent-hole of a loaded 32-pounder cannon, which was fired by a train of gunpowder,
when the rush from the vent projected the 24-pounder ball to a very considerable
height in the air, although the diameter of the hole was only two-tenths of an inch.</p>

<p>Experiment 5.&mdash;A most ingenious method of ascertaining the relative quickness
of ignition of different qualities of gunpowder.</p>

<p>A gun-barrel mounted on a carriage with wheels, and moving on a perfectly
horizontal railway, is placed at right angles to another short railway, at any convenient
distance (suppose fifty feet, or yards); on the second railway a light carriage moves
freely with any desired velocity, being drawn forward by means of a weight and
pulleys: a cord is attached to the front of this carriage, which passes over a pulley at
the end of the railroad, and is continued up a high pole or staff over another pulley
at the top, at which end the weight is attached. A long rectangular frame covered
with paper is fixed perpendicularly on the carriage, so that when it moves forward it
passes across the direct line of the barrel, and forms a long target. A percussion lock
is attached to the barrel, which is fired by a detent, or hair-trigger, and the wire which
pulls it is disengaged at the same instant to admit of recoil. This wire is carried
straight on to the target railroad, and fixed to a small lever, against which the front
part of the target-carriage strikes as it is carried onwards by the weight. This constitutes
the whole apparatus. When required to be used, the barrel is loaded with
gunpowder accurately weighed, and a brass ball that fits the bore correctly: the
weight is then disengaged, and the target moves quickly along, discharging the barrel
as it passes, and the ball goes through it. With the same powder tried at the same
time, the ball constantly goes through the same hole, or breaks into it. If the next
powder tried be slower of ignition than the preceding, the ball will pass through
another part of the target more in the rear; if quicker, more in advance; thus affording
a means of ascertaining this important quality of gunpowder with considerable accuracy:
the velocity of the target-carriage can be easily regulated by increasing or
diminishing the weight which draws it forward. The differences in the distances
between which the balls strike the target with different kinds of powder was
frequently as much as ten or twelve inches; but it is not an apparatus commonly
used, having been merely constructed for experimental purposes.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span></p>

<h3>ON THE TIME REQUIRED FOR IGNITION OF GUNPOWDER.</h3>

<p>Gunpowder like all other inflammable substances requires to be raised to a
certain temperature, before it will ignite, viz., to a dull red heat, or about 600&deg;
Fahrenheit. If the heat passes with such rapidity through the powder, so as not to
raise the temperature to the necessary degree, then the powder will not ignite, from
the velocity of transit, so that it might be possible to calculate theoretically, the
velocity that must be given to a red hot ball to enable it to pass through a barrel of
gunpowder without causing explosion. The passage of electric fluid through
gunpowder may be adduced in evidence of the ignition being dependent on the
degree of velocity. The flame of all fulminating powders will pass through the centre
of a box filled with gunpowder without igniting one grain of it. If a train of gunpowder
be crossed at right angles by a train of fulminating mercury, laid on a sheet
of paper or a table, and the powder be lighted with a red hot iron wire, the flame
will run on until it meets the cross train of fulminating mercury, when the inflammation
of the latter will be so instantaneous as to cut off all connection with the
continuous train of powder, leaving the remaining portion of the gunpowder unignited.
If on the contrary the fulminating powder be lighted first, it will go straight on and
pass through the train of gunpowder so rapidly, as not to inflame it at all. Were a
gun to be charged with gun-cotton and gunpowder, the latter would be fired out
unignited.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>EFFECTS OF ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSIONS OF GUNPOWDER.</h3>

<p>Considering the combustible nature of the materials, accidents very seldom
occur; when they do, it is more frequently in the process at the Mill while under the
runners.</p>

<p>On one occasion at Waltham Abbey Mills, when the powder exploded, after
having been two hours under the runners, the doors and windows of the Mills on the
opposite side of the stream, were forced open outwards, and the nails drawn. A
similar effect took place when the Dartford Mills blew up, January 1833, in consequence
of an accident in the packing house. A window which had been recently
fitted up in Dartford Town, about a mile and a half distant from the works, was
blown outwards into the street, and a considerable quantity of paper was carried as
far as Eltham and Lewisham, distances of eight and ten miles. The sudden
rarification of the air may account for this circumstance, the atmospheric pressure
being removed in the vicinity of the doors and windows, they were forced open outwards
by the expansive force of the air contained within the buildings.</p>

<div class="sidenotetext">

<h2>ON ANCIENT ENGINES OF WAR.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">War a painful
topic.</p>

<p>The Utopian may shrink from the contemplation of so painful a subject as War,
the Moralist may raise his voice against the justice of it, but the practical philosopher
can see very little chance of its cessation, and actuated with the very best intentions,
<span class="sidenote">Advantages
of war being
destructive.</span>will endeavour to render War as terrible as possible, well knowing, that as soon as
certain death awaits two rival armies, princes must fight their own battles, or war
must cease.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First missile
weapons,
sticks and
stones.</p>

<p>Man&#8217;s first rude attempts at missile weapons were doubtless limited to throwing
sticks and stones by the mere aid of his hands; acts in which the monkey, the bear,
and even the seal are very successful emulators. A desire of more successful
aggression, together with increased facilities for the destruction of game and wild
animals, doubtless soon suggested to man the use of projectiles more efficient than
these. <span class="sidenote">Javelin.</span>By a very slight change of form, the simple stick would become a javelin,
capable of being hurled with great force and precision. <span class="sidenote">Sling.</span>An aid would suggest
itself for casting a stone, by means of a fillet or band, subsequently called a sling, <span class="sidenote">Bow.</span>and
next would be invented the bow, which, in process of time by subsequent additions
<span class="sidenote">Arbalest.</span>would become the arbalest or cross-bow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Axes used as
projectiles.</p>

<p>It appears that axes have been used as <i>projectiles</i>: for Procopius, describing the
expedition of the Franks into Italy, in the sixth century, tells us:&mdash;Among the
hundred thousand men that King Theodobert I. led into Italy, there were but few
horsemen. The cavalry carried spears. The infantry had neither bow nor spear, all
their arms being a sword, an axe, and a shield. The blade of the axe was large, its
handle of wood, and very short. They <i>hurl</i> their axes against the shields of the
enemy, which by this means are broken; and then, springing on the foe, they complete
his destruction with the sword.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tomahawk
used as a projectile.</p>

<p>A hatchet or tomahawk is used as a projectile weapon by the North American
Indians. The difficulty of throwing such a weapon with effect, would of course consist
in causing the edge to strike the object aimed at. Now, such a hatchet as they
usually make use of, if thrown by its handle, will revolve in a perpendicular plane
about once in every three yards, irrespective of the force with which it moves. An
Indian judges his enemy to be distant from him any multiple of 3 yards as 15, 18, 21,
and strikes him full with the edge of his weapon accordingly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">&#8220;Chuckur&#8221; or
disk used as a
projectile.</p>

<p>A circular disk or quoit is in use in India amongst the Sikhs, particularly that
sect of them called Akali, as a weapon, and in their warlike exercises; the species<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
used in war have a triangular section, those thrown for amusement are flat with a sharp
edge. A skilful man will throw one of these chuckers or quoits to a distance of a
hundred and thirty yards, or more, with very considerable accuracy, the quoit being
at no period of its flight above six feet from the ground. The sharpness of edge,
combined with the rotatory motion of these quoits, and the difficulty of avoiding them,
renders them formidable weapons in skilled hands. The Akali wear them on their
turbans, of several different sizes and weights; a small one is often worn as a bracelet
on the arm. Many of these fanatics took part in the last Sikh war, and severe wounds
made with these weapons were by no means uncommon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Armour and
fortifications.</p>

<p>By the time portable weapons would have been brought to some degree of perfection,
man&#8217;s increasing sciences and civilization would have led him to make armour,
to build cities, and enclose them with walls. Now would arise the necessity for other
projectiles of greater force, inasmuch as in the event of war, the armour should be
penetrated, and walls, &amp;c., would have to be demolished.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Improved
projectiles.</p>

<p>The transition from portable projectiles to those of a heavier class was obvious
enough. <span class="sidenote">Change to
heavy projectiles.</span>Enormous javelins and darts were hurled by cross-bows of corresponding
size, termed <span class="sidenote">Catapulta.</span>Catapult&aelig;, (<a href="#Plate10">plate x.</a>), and stones,
&amp;c., were thrown by <span class="sidenote">Balist&aelig;.</span>Balist&aelig; (<a href="#Plate9">plate
ix.</a> and <a href="#Plate12">xii</a>); and secondly, <span class="sidenote">Sling
principles.</span>instruments formed on the principle of the sling.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Projectiles
used with
Catapulta.</p>

<p>These machines threw not only large darts and stones, but also the bodies of men
and horses. Athen&aelig;us speaks of a Catapulta which was only one foot long, and threw
an arrow to the distance of half a mile. Other engines, it is said, could throw javelins
from one side of the Danube to the other. Balist&aelig; threw great beams of wood, lances
twelve cubits long, and stones that weighed three hundred pounds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Millstones,
&amp;c., used in
England.</p>

<p>Our forefathers used to cast forth mill-stones. Holinshead relates that when
Edward I. besieged Stively Castle, he caused certain engines to be made, which shot
off stones of two or three hundred weight.</p>

<p>The first intimation of trees being cut down &#8220;to build bulwarks against the city
till it be subdued,&#8221; occurs in <span class="sidenote">B.&nbsp;C. 1451.</span>Deut. xx., 19, 20, but the earliest precise mention of
Artillery is in <span class="sidenote">B.&nbsp;C. 809.</span>2nd Chron., xxvi, 15, where we are told that Uzziah &#8220;made in Jerusalem
engines invented by cunning men, to be upon the towers and upon the bulwarks,
to shoot arrows and great stones withal;&#8221; and Josephus relates that Uzziah <span class="sidenote">First mention
of Artillery.</span>&#8220;made
many engines of war for besieging cities, such as hurl stones and darts with grapplers,
and other instruments of that sort.&#8221; He must therefore be considered the inventor of
them, and from that time they began to be employed in attacking and defending
towns.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Balist&aelig; at Regium,
B.&nbsp;C. 388.</p>

<p>The earliest instances of projectile machines in profane history appear to be at
the siege of Regium and <span class="sidenote">At Motya
B.&nbsp;C. 370.</span>Motya by Dionysius, where, having battered the walls with
his rams, he advanced towards them towers rolled on wheels, from whence he galled
the besieged with continual volleys of stones and arrows, thrown from his Balist&aelig; and
Catapult&aelig;.</p>

<p class="sidenote">At Rhodes
B.&nbsp;C. 303.</p>

<p>The next memorable instance is the siege of Rhodes by Demetrius Polyorcetes,
who brought forward a newly invented machine, called Helepolis, (taker of Cities),
with a variety of other engines, and employed 30,000 men in the management of them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Balist&aelig; at
Cremona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span></p>

<p>Tacitus mentions an extraordinary engine, used by the 15th Legion at the battle
of Cremona, against the troops of Vespasian. It was a Balista of enormous size,
which discharged stones of weight sufficient to crush whole ranks at once. Inevitable
ruin would have been the consequence, had not two soldiers, undiscovered, cut the
ropes and springs. At length, after a vigorous assault from Antonius, the Vittelians,
unable to resist the shock, rolled down the engine, and crushed numbers of their
assailants, but the machine, in falling, drew after it a neighbouring tower, the parapet,
and part of the wall, which afforded the besiegers easier access to the city.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Balist&aelig; at
siege of Jotapata.</p>

<p>Josephus relates that at the siege of Jotapata, &#8220;a stone from one of the Roman
engines carried the head of a soldier, who was standing by him, three furlongs off;&#8221;
that &#8220;lances were thrown with great noise, and stones, weighing 114lbs. troy,
&#8220;together with fire and a multitude of arrows.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Dead men and
horses projected.</span>The dead bodies of men and horses
were also thrown at this siege, and at that of Jerusalem, <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 70, to inspire terror.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of Balist&aelig;.</p>

<p>The earliest form of Balist&aelig; appears to have been a very long beam, suspended
in a frame on a centre of motion, one end being considerably longer than the other.
To the short end was attached a great weight, such as a chest filled with earth or
stones. To the longer end a sling was affixed, in which, after being drawn down, a
stone was placed, and on being suddenly let go, the long end flew up, and discharged
the stone with great violence.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of Catapult&aelig;.</p>

<p>Catapult&aelig; were sometimes constructed to discharge a flight of arrows at once, by
placing them on a rack, and causing a strong plank, previously drawn back, to strike
against their ends. The more perfect engines of the Romans were all dependent on
the elasticity of twisted cords made of flax, hemp, the sinews or tendons of animals,
from the neck of the bull, or legs of the deer species, and ropes formed of human
hair were preferred to all others, as possessing greater strength and elasticity. Catapult&aelig;
were immensely powerful bows, drawn back by capstans, levers, or pulleys,
having only a single cord for the arrow, (<a href="#Plate10">plate x.</a>), but the Balist&aelig; had a broad band,
formed of several ropes to project the stone, which was placed in a kind of cradle,
like a cross-bow. (<a href="#Plate12">plate xii.</a>)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Balist&aelig; at
battle of
Hastings 1066</p>

<p>The Normans appear to have introduced a kind of Field-Artillery, consisting of
instruments or machines, from which darts and stones were thrown to a considerable
distance, as they occur at the battle of Hastings. They also employed arrows, headed
with combustible matter, for firing towns and shipping.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fiery darts,
A.&nbsp;D. 64.</p>

<p>We read in the Scriptures of &#8220;Fiery Darts.&#8221; Ephns. vi., 16.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fire from Balist&aelig;.</p>

<p>Our ancestors derived the knowledge of some composition from the Saracens,
which resembled Greek-fire, and was often thrown in pots from the Balist&aelig;.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fire by Arabs
commencement
of 13th
century.</p>

<p>From a treatise on the &#8220;Art of Fighting,&#8221; by Hassan Abrammah, we learn that
the Arabs of the 13th century employed their incendiary compositions in four different
ways. They cast them by hand; they fixed them to staves, with which they
attacked their enemies; they poured forth fire through tubes; and they projected
burning mixtures of various kinds by means of arrows, javelins, and the missiles of
great engines.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bombs of
glass, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p>Vessels of glass or pottery, discharged by hand or by machines, were so contrived,
that on striking the object at which they were aimed, their contents spread
around, and the fire, already communicated by a fusee, enveloped everything within
its reach. <span class="sidenote">Fire-mace.</span>A soldier, on whose head was broken a fire-mace, became suddenly soaked
with a diabolic fluid, which covered him from head to foot with flame.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bombs from
Balist&aelig;.</p>

<p>Bombs were also thrown from Balist&aelig;. An engine was constructed at Gibraltar,
under the direction of General Melville, at the desire of Lord Heathfield, for the
purpose of throwing stones just over the edge of the rock, in a place where the
Spaniards used to resort, and where shells thrown from mortars could not injure or
annoy them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Onager.</p>

<p>Of machines formed on the sling principle, that called Onager (<a href="#Plate7">plates vii.</a> and
<a href="#Plate8">viii.</a>) may be regarded as typical of all the rest. Its force entirely depended upon the
torsion of a short thick rope, acting upon a lever which described an arc of a vertical
circle. The lever had attached to its free extremity a sling, or sometimes it merely
terminated in a spoon-shaped cavity. When bent back, it was secured by a catch or
trigger, and charged with a stone. On starting the catch by a blow with a mallet,
the lever described its arc of a circle with great velocity, and projected the stone to a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>I shall now briefly describe some of the portable missive weapons which have
been used by different nations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Javelin.</p>

<p>The Javelin, or dart, variously modified, is known under several names. The
ancients were well acquainted with it. In the Scriptures, we have frequent notice of
it; and the ancients instituted javelin matches. It would appear that the javelin used
on horseback was about five feet and a half long, and headed with steel, usually three-sided,
but sometimes round. <span class="sidenote">Arms of the
early Romans.</span>The Roman Cavalry, after the conquest of Greece,
were armed much like the Infantry, carrying swords, shields, and javelins with points
at both ends. <span class="sidenote">Aid to projection.</span>Sometimes, in order to launch it with greater force, it was not propelled
by the unaided arm, but by the assistance of a thong fastened to its butt end;
and we are informed that the Greeks and Romans projected darts and javelins by the
assistance of a sling or strap, girt round their middle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Djereed.</p>

<p>At the present time, a javelin, termed Djereed, is used with considerable effect
by certain oriental nations, who invariably employ it on horseback. <span class="sidenote">Pilum.</span>The Roman
infantry possessed a weapon of the javelin kind, termed Pilum, every man of the
legionary soldiers carrying two. The point of this weapon being very long and small,
was usually so bent at the first discharge as to be rendered useless afterwards. With
every improvement that the javelin was susceptible of, it never could acquire a long
range; hence we find, that as Archery became developed, the use of the weapon
declined. Amongst savage nations, the use of the javelin is very common, <span class="sidenote">Australian
mode.</span>but the
inhabitants of Australia have a manner of throwing it altogether peculiar to themselves,
not throwing it while poised at the balance, but projecting it by means of a
stick applied at the butt end. This contrivance accomplishes a great increase of
range, but does not contribute to accuracy of direction. At short distances, the
penetrating force of the javelin is considerable, as is learned from the act of harpooning
a whale, <span class="sidenote">Harpoon.</span>a harpoon being merely a javelin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span></p>

<h3>THE SLING.</h3>

<p>Means by which stones would be thrown by greater force than the hand, would
naturally be resorted to; accordingly we find the sling ranks amongst the first of
ancient offensive weapons. <span class="sidenote">Slings mentioned
in
Judges. B.&nbsp;C.
1406.</span>Numerous examples are mentioned in Scripture, as in
Judges xx., 16, <span class="sidenote">Slings used

every one could sling stones at a hair breadth and not miss;&#8221; and also that
of David and Goliath, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Siege of Troy
between 800
and 900 B.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>At the siege of Troy, the masses were organized into two kinds of infantry: one
light and irregular, carrying horn bows, short darts, and slings; the other regular and
heavy, armed with spears. <span class="sidenote">Battle of the

334.</span>At the battle of the Granicus, <span class="smcapall">B.&nbsp;C.</span> 334, Alexander the

<p>The Sling was very common in Greece, and used by the light armed soldiers.
Arrows, stones, and leaden plummets, were thrown from them, some of which weighed
no less than an Attic pound. Seneca reports that its motion was so vehement that the
leaden plummets were frequently melted!!! <span class="sidenote">Slingers in

Ph&#339;nicians
and also to
inhabitants of
Balearic
islands.</p>

<p>Pliny ascribes the invention of slings to the Ph&#339;nicians, but Vegetius to the
inhabitants of the Balearic Islands, who were famous in antiquity for using them. It
is said, those people bore three kinds of slings, some longer and others shorter, to be
used as their enemies were nearer or more remote; the first served them for a head
band, the second for a girdle, and the third they always carried in their hands. In
fight they threw large stones with such violence, that they seemed to be projected from
some machine, and with such exactness, as rarely to miss their aim; being constantly
exercised from their infancy, their mothers not allowing them to have any food, until
they struck it down from the top of a pole with stones thrown from their slings.</p>

<p>The Latin for our English word farm is <i>fundus</i>, which originally signifies a
&#8220;stone&#8217;s-throw of land,&#8221; or as much land as could be included within the range of a
stone thrown from a sling. <span class="sidenote">Materials of
slings.</span>The materials of which slings were composed, were either
flax, hair or leather, woven into bands or cut into thongs, broad in the centre to
receive the load, and tapering off to the extremities. <span class="sidenote">Slings with
cup.</span>Slings have been made with
three strings, with a cup let into the leather to hold the bullet or stone, and were called
&#8220;Fronde &agrave; cul&ocirc;t.&#8221; In <a href="#Plate13">plate xiii</a>, fig. 3, there is a representation of a slinger of the
early part of the thirteenth century, whose weapon differs from that of the Anglo-Saxon
or common sling, in having a cup for the reception of the projectile. Slings
were sometimes attached to sticks to increase their power, as, besides the ancient cord
sling, there appears in the manuscripts of the thirteenth century a variety of this arm;
the <span class="sidenote">Staff-sling.</span>&#8220;Staff Sling.&#8221;
(<a href="#Plate13">plate xiii</a>, fig. 2.) It seems to have been in vogue for naval warfare,
or in the conflicts of siege operations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Force of slings.</p>

<p>The slings projected their missiles with such force that no armour could resist
their stroke. Slings never appear to have been much used by the English,
<span class="sidenote">Used for the

Froissart mentions an instance of their having been used for them by the people of
Brittany, in a battle fought in that province during the reign of Philip de Valois,
between the troops of Walter de Manin, an English knight, and Louis d&#8217;Espagne,
who commanded six thousand men on behalf of Charles de Blois, then competitor
with the Earl of Montford for the Duchy of Brittany. Froissart says, that what
made Louis lose the battle was, <span class="sidenote">Bullets out of

unexpectedly and assaulted his army with <i>bullets</i> and slings.</p>

<p>According to the same author, slings were used in naval combats, when stones
were also sometimes thrown by hand.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="sidenote">Slings at the

Sancere by the Huguenots, in order to save their powder. They were also used by
the people of Brittany to such an extent against the Roman Catholic party, that the
war was called &#8220;Guerre de Fronde.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Range.</span>With respect to the range of this projectile,
it is said, that a good slinger could project a stone 600 yards. This seems doubtful.
<span class="sidenote">Slings last

St. Jacques of the French Corps de Genie, who was most successfully employed with a
small French garrison in the defence of the Castles of Monzowin, Arragon, against the
Spaniards, 1814.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
It is stated by Sir Robert Wilson that at the battle of Alexandria the French and English threw
stones at each other, during a temporary want of ammunition, with such effect that a Serjeant of the 28th Regiment
was killed, and several of the men were wounded. Stones were thrown by the English Guards at the battle of
Inkerman.</p>

<h3>THE BOW.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">The bow
almost
universal.</p>

<p>This weapon under some shape or other was employed by most nations of
antiquity, but not always as a warlike instrument. Scarcely any two nations made
their bows exactly alike. The Scythian bow we are told, was very much curved,
as are the Turkish, Persian, and Chinese bows (<a href="#Plate4">plate iv.</a> figs. 1 &amp; 2) at the present
day, whilst the celebrated weapon of our ancestors when unstrung was nearly straight.</p>

<p>It is now used among those savage tribes of Africa and America, to which fire-arms
have not yet reached.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bows in
Scripture.</p>

<p>We frequently read of the bow in Scripture, and the first passage in which the
use of the bow is inferred, is in Gen. xxi. 20, where it is said of Ishmael, &#8220;And
God was with the lad, and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness and became an
archer.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Bows B.&nbsp;C.
1892.</span>But in the 16th verse it is said that Hagar his mother, &#8220;sat her down over
against him, a good way off, as it were a <i>bow shot</i>; for she said let me not see the
death of the child&#8221;:&mdash;this verse implies an earlier practice with the bow than can
be adduced by any profane historian. <span class="sidenote">B.&nbsp;C. 1760.</span>In Gen. xxvii. 3, Isaac directs his son Esau:
&#8220;Now therefore take I pray thee thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to
the field, and take me some venison; and make me savory meat, such as I love, and
bring it to me that I may eat, and that my soul may bless thee before I die.&#8221; The
overthrow of Saul was particularly owing to the Philistine archers; and &#8220;David<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow.&#8221; The companies that
came to David at Ziklag were armed with bows, and &#8220;could use the right hand and
the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows.&#8221; (I. Chron. xii. 2.) <span class="sidenote">B.&nbsp;C. 1058.</span>The bow is of
very high antiquity among the Greeks, whose bows were usually made of wood, but
sometimes of horn, and frequently in either case beautifully ornamented with gold and
silver; the string generally made of twisted hair, but sometimes of hide. <span class="sidenote">Manner of
drawing the
bow.</span>The ancient
Persians drew the strings towards their ears, as is the practice still with the English.
The ancient Greeks, however, drew the bowstring towards their breast, and represented
the fabled Amazons as doing the same, and hence the tradition of these
people cutting off their right breasts, in order to give facility for drawing the bow.
<span class="sidenote">First used by
Romans.</span>Until the second Punic war, the Romans had no archers in their armies, except those
who came with their auxiliary forces. Subsequently they became more employed,
although as far as we can learn, not by native troops, but by Orientals in their pay.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bows of
Britons.</p>

<p>The early Britons had merely bows and arrows of reed, with flint or bone heads.
<span class="sidenote">Bows of
Welsh.</span>Arrows were used by the Welch in Norman reigns, who were famous archers; their
bows were made of wild elm, but stout, and not calculated to shoot a great distance,
but their arrows would inflict very severe wounds in close fight. Their arrows would
pierce oaken boards four inches thick. <span class="sidenote">Bows of
Anglo-Saxons.</span>The bow was also a weapon of war among
the Anglo-Saxons. The Salic law shows that both the sling and the bow were used
by the contemporary Franks; and they even used poisoned arrows. The Anglo-Saxon
bow was of the form of the Grecian, but it was only under the Normans that the bow
became a master weapon; the Saxons principally using it, like the people of Tahiti of
the present day, for killing birds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">No bows in
France A.&nbsp;D.
514.</p>

<p>During the reign of Clovis, the French made no use of the bow in their armies,
but it was employed during the reign of Charlemagne, who flourished in the end of
the eighth century; as a Count is mentioned, who was directed on conducting
soldiers to the army, to see they had their proper arms; that is a lance, a buckler, a
bow, two strings, and twelve arrows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A.&nbsp;D. 1066.
Harold shot
with an arrow</p>

<p>William the Conqueror was a skilful archer, and the battle of Hastings was
decided by the bow, and we hear that Harold was shot with an arrow. <span class="sidenote">Known by
Danes and
Saxons.</span>Although
the Anglo-Saxons and Danes were well acquainted with the bow from the earliest
period, it appears to have been only employed for obtaining food, or for pastime, and
we are perhaps indebted to the Norman Conquest for its introduction as a military
weapon. <span class="sidenote">As a military
weapon at the
battle of
Hastings.</span>The Normans at the battle of Hastings are said to have used the
arbalest or cross-bow as well as the long bow. Ever after this, the bow became
a favourite weapon. During the reign of Henry II., archery was much
cultivated, and great numbers of bowmen were constantly brought into the field; <span class="sidenote">Archery
encouraged
by statute.</span>and
to encourage its practice, a law was passed, which freed from the charge of murder
any one who in practising with arrows or darts, should kill a person standing near.
This appears to be the first regulation to be found in our annals, and was probably
founded on the old law of Rome. <span class="sidenote">Long bow in
conquest of
Ireland 1172.</span>The English conquests in Ireland during the reign
of Henry II. were principally owing to the use of the long bow in battle, which the
Irish wanted. The Invasion of Ireland was headed by Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
surnamed &#8220;Strong-bow.&#8221; His force was numerically very small, consisting
chiefly of archers, and it is stated that such was the advantage their superior arms
and military skill gave the invaders, that 10 knights and 70 archers defeated a body
of 3000 Irish opposed to them, on their landing near Waterford.</p>

<p>The exact time when shooting with the long-bow began in England is unsettled,
<span class="sidenote">A.&nbsp;D. 1199.</span>our chroniclers do not mention archery till the death of Richard I.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry III. there were among the English infantry, slingers,
archers, and cross-bow men.</p>

<p>It seems that the long-bow was at its zenith in the reign of Edward III., who
appears to have taken great pains to increase its efficacy, and to extend its use. <span class="sidenote">Cressy 1346.</span>The
terrible execution effected by the English archers at Cressy, <span class="sidenote">Poictiers 1356.</span>and at Poictiers ten years
after, was occasioned by British archers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Homelden
1403.</p>

<p>The decisive victory over the Scots at Homelden was entirely achieved by them,
and the Earl of Douglas found the English arrows were so swift and strong, that no
armour could repel them; though his own was of the most perfect temper, he was
wounded in five places. The English men-at-arms, knights and squires, never drew
sword or couched lance, the whole affair being decided by the archers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Shrewsbury
1403.</p>

<p>They again did terrible execution at the battle of Shrewsbury, in 1403, where
Hotspur was slain, <span class="sidenote">Agincourt
1415.</span>and the battle of Agincourt was their undivided conquest.</p>

<p class="sidenote">20,000 bow-men
1455.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VI., the Parliament voted an army of 20,000 bow-men
for service in France. The battle of St. Albans, 1455, seems to have been
entirely won by the archers. <span class="sidenote">Bow preferred
to fire-arms.</span>Although fire-arms had attained no inconsiderable
degree of perfection in the reign of Henry VIII., yet the long-bow was still the
favourite weapon. Indeed, in the reign of Elizabeth, the musket was so unwieldy,
and slow to charge and discharge, that the bow was considered superior by many.
We find that Queen Elizabeth, 1572, engaged to furnish Charles IX. of France with
6,000 men, part to be armed with long, and part with cross-bows; <span class="sidenote">Bows at Isle
of R&eacute;, 1627.</span>and in the attack
made by the English on the Isle of R&eacute;, 1627, it is said some cross-bow-men were in
the army. In 1643 a company of archers was raised for the service of Charles
I.; <span class="sidenote">Bows against
Scots, 1644
to 1647.</span>and in a pamphlet printed in 1664, there is an account of the successes of the
Marquis of Montrose against the Scots; and bow-men are repeatedly mentioned as in
the battle. <span class="sidenote">Bows in
William 3rd&#8217;s
time.</span>The Grenadiers of the Highland Regiments, in the time of William III.,
when recruiting, wore the old red bonnet, and carried bows and arrows with them.</p>

<p>The Highland bow was very short, and by no means powerful.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>MERITS OF THE LONG BOW.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Range of
long-bow.</p>

<p>The English could not accomplish more than 600 yards, except on a few extraordinary
occasions; our modern archers not more than from 300 to 500 yards. The
Turkish ambassador when in England in 1795, sent an arrow upwards of 480 yards;
and there are two or three instances on record since archery has been merely a
pastime, which have exceeded it by twenty or thirty yards. <span class="sidenote">Accuracy of
long-bow.</span>It is said of Domitian,
that he would cause one of his slaves to stand at a great distance with his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
spread as a mark, and would shoot his arrows so correctly as to drive them between
his fingers. Commodus, with an arrow headed with a semi-circular cutting edge,
could cut or sever the neck of a bird. The story of William Tell, who struck an
apple placed upon his child&#8217;s head, is well known, and generally regarded in the
light of an historical fact. It is stated that Robin Hood could split a hazel wand.</p>

<p>In a journal of Edward VI., His Majesty relates that 100 archers of his guard
shot before him two arrows each, and afterwards altogether. The object aimed at
was a well-seasoned deal board, one inch thick. <span class="sidenote">Penetration
of long-bow.</span>Many pierced it quite through, and
some struck in a board on the other side. The distance is not mentioned, but we
know that Henry VIII. prohibited any one above the age of 25 to shoot at a mark
at a less distance than 200 yards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages
of the long-bow.</p>

<p>The long-bow was light, inexpensive, and unaffected by weather, as the strings
could be removed. Moreover, 12 arrows could be fired with accuracy in one minute.
Two feathers in an arrow were to be white, and one brown or grey, and this difference
in colour informed the archer in an instant how to place the arrow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of the
long-bow.</p>

<p>Although arrows could be shot from a bow with far greater rapidity and precision
than balls from a musket, yet in damp weather the bow and string might
become so much relaxed that the efficacy of the instrument became much impaired.
A side wind deflected the arrow exceedingly in its flight, and even against a moderate
wind, it was difficult to shoot at all.</p>

was passed in the reign of Henry II.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Richard 2nd

1399.</p>

<p>An Act of Parliament was passed in the reign of Richard II., to compel all
servants to shoot on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Edward 4th
from 1461 to
1483.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward IV., an act was passed, <span class="sidenote">Every man to

have a bow of his own height, and during the same reign butts were ordered to be
put up in every township for the inhabitants to shoot at on feast days, and if any
neglected, the penalty of one halfpenny was incurred. The same monarch also passed
an act, that bows were to be sold for 5s. 4d.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bows
prohibited by
Henry 7th &amp;
Henry 8th.</p>

<p>Henry VII. prohibited the use of the cross-bow, and Henry VIII., less than
twenty years after, renewed the prohibition. He forbad the use of cross-bows and
hand guns, and passed a statute which inflicted a fine of &pound;10 for keeping a cross-bow
in the house. Every man, being the King&#8217;s subject, was obliged to exercise himself
in shooting with the long bow, and also to keep a bow with arrows continually in his
house. Fathers and guardians were also commanded to teach their male children the
use of the long bow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Encouraged
by Philip and
Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span></p>

<p>A statute of Philip and Mary mentions the quantity and kind of armour and

&pound;5 and under &pound;10 per annum, one coat of plate furnished, one black bill or halbert,
one long bow, one sheaf of arrows, and one steel cap or skull.&#8221;</p>

<p>Numerous statutes were passed to encourage archery in the reigns of Henry VIII.,
Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. in whose reign the legislature interfered for the
last time in 1633, when Charles I. issued a commission for preventing the fields near
London being so enclosed, &#8220;as to interrupt the necessary and profitable exercise of
&#8220;shooting,&#8221; and also a proclamation for the use of the bow and pike together:&mdash;<span class="sidenote">Proclamation

our loving subjects should conform themselves thereunto, knowing the exercise of
shooting to be a means to preserve health, strength and agility of body, and to avoid
idleness, unlawfull disports, drunkenness, and such like enormities and disorders,
which are too frequent among our people.&#8221;</p>

<h4>2<span class="fsize70">ND.</span>&mdash;BY THE FOUNDERS OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Estimation of
archery by
founders of
schools.</p>

<p>The founders of our Grammar Schools appear to have considered that the
acquirement of skill in archery by their scholars was no less worthy of attention than
their moral and intellectual improvement. They provided by their statutes sound
learning and a religious education for all, but secured the removal of such as shewed
no aptitude or disposition to learn. They also prescribed the amusements and
exercises of the scholars, and prohibited such as were calculated to lead to idle and
vicious habits. In fact, as true patriots, they understood how the sons of free men
ought to be educated in youth, and that &#8220;a complete and generous education is that
which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices,
both private and public, of peace and war.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Harrow
School,
founded 1571.</p>

<p>The founder of Harrow School, Mr. John Lyon, prepared a body of statutes to
be observed in the management of the School. By one of these he limited the amusements
of the Scholars &#8220;to driving a top, tossing a hand-ball, running, shooting, and
no other.&#8221; By another he ordered:&mdash;&#8220;You shall allow your child at all times,
bow-shafts, bow-strings, and a bracer, to exercise shooting.&#8221; On the entrance-porch
to the Master&#8217;s house are two shields, the one bearing the Lion rampant,
the other, two arrows crossed, an ancient device which had its origin in the design of
the founder. This device is also impressed on the exterior of all books which are
presented by the Head-Master as prizes to those scholars, whose improvement entitled
them to such rewards. The practice of archery was coeval with the foundation of the
School, and was continued for nearly two centuries. Every year there was a public
exhibition of archery, when the scholars shot for a silver arrow. The last silver arrow
was contended for in 1771.</p>

<p class="sidenote">St. Albans

shooting.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Wilton
School.</p>

<p>Sir John Dean, who founded, in 1558, the Grammar School of Wilton, in
Cheshire, framed a body of statutes for the School. One of them provides:&mdash;&#8220;That
upon Thursdays and Saturdays, in the afternoons, and upon holidays, the scholars
refresh themselves, and that as well in the vacations as in the days aforesaid, they
use their bows and arrows only, and eschew all bowling, carding, dicing, cocking,
and all other unlawful games, upon pain of extreme punishment to be done by the
Schoolmaster.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dedham

<p>The Free Grammar School of Dedham, in Essex, was endowed in 1571, and confirmed

<h3>MEANS BY WHICH SKILL IN ARCHERY WAS ACQUIRED.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">An archer
made by long
training, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A successful archer could only be constituted by long training, strength, and
address, we need not therefore wonder that the practice of the long-bow was not more
copied by our neighbours, as the French pertinaciously adhered to the use of the
cross-bow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Every man
had arms.</p>

<p>Etienne di Perlin, a Frenchman who wrote an account of a tour in England in
1558, says:&mdash;&#8220;The husbandmen leave their bucklers and swords, or sometimes their
bow, in the corner of the field, so that every one in this land bears arms;&#8221; and it is
also stated that all the youth and manhood of the yeomanry of England were engaged
in the practice of the long-bow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Public
matches.</p>

<p>Public exhibitions of shooting with the bow continued during the reigns of
Charles II. and James II., and an archer&#8217;s division, at least till within these few years,
formed a branch of the Artillery Company. The most important society of this kind
now existing is &#8220;The Royal Company of Archers, the King&#8217;s body-guard of Scotland.&#8221;
The exact time of its institution is unknown, but it is referred by the Scottish antiquarians
to the reign of their James I.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Causes of bad
shooting.</p>

<p>Roger Ascham, in &#8220;Toxophilos,&#8221; states that the main difficulty in learning to
shoot, arises from having acquired and become confirmed in previous bad habits; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
that, &#8220;use is the onlye cause of all faultes in it, and therefore children more easelye
and soner may be taught to shoote excellently then men, because children may be
taught to shoote well at the first, menne have more paine to unlearne their ill uses
than they have labour afterwarde to come to good shootinge;&#8221; and after having
enumerated a long list of faults ordinarily committed, he thus proceeds to describe the
secret of shooting straight with the long-bow.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Shooting depends
on the
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;For having a man&#8217;s eye alwaye on his marke, is the onlye waye to shoote
straighte, yea, and I suppose so redye and easye a waye, if it be learned in youth
and confirmed with use, that a man shall never misse therein. Men doubt yet in
loking at the marke what way is best, whether betwixt the bow and the stringe,
above or beneath his hande, and manye wayes moo. Yet it maketh no greate
matter which waye a man loke at his marke, if it be joined with comlye shooting.
The diversitye of mens standing and drawing causeth divers men loke at their marke
divers wayes; yet they all had a mans hand to shoote straighte if nothinge els
stoppe. So that cumlynesse is the onlye judge of best lokinge at the marke. Some
men wonder whye in castinge a man&#8217;s eye at the mark, the hande should go streight.
Surely if he considered the nature of a man&#8217;s eye, hee woulde not wonder at it. <span class="sidenote">The hand
obeys the eye.</span>For
this I am certaine of, that no servaunt to his maister, no child to his father, is so
obedient as everye joynte and peece of the bodye is to do whatsoever the eye
biddes. The eye is the guide, the ruler, and the succourer of all the other parts.
The hande, the foote, and other members dare do nothinge withoute the eye, as
doth appear on the night and darcke corners. The eye is the very tongue wherewith
witte and reason doth speake to everye parte of the bodye, and the witte doth
not so soone signifye a thinge by the eye, as every part is redye to followe, or rather
prevent the bidding of the eye. This is plaine in manye thinges, but most evident
in fence and feighting, as I have heard men saye. There every parte standing in feare
to have a blowe, runnes to the eye for help, as younge children do to the mother;
the foote, the hande, and all wayteth upon the eye. If the eye bid the hand eyther
beare of or smite, or the foote eyther go forward or backeward, it doth so. And
that which is most wonder of al, the one man lokinge stedfastlye at the other mans
eye and not at his hand, wil, even as it were, rede in his eye wher he purposeth to
smyte next, for the eye is nothing els but a certain windowe for wit to shoote out
her heade at. This wonderfull worke of God in making all the members so obedient
to the eye, is a pleasant thing to remember and loke upon: therefore an archer may
be sure in learninge to loke at his marke when hee is younge alwayes to shoote
streight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following description of the English archer is from an ancient treatise on
Martial <span class="nowrap">Discipline:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Archer to
wear easy
dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;The yeoman hadde, at those dayes, their lymmes at libertye, for their hoseyn
were then fastened with one point, and their jackes were long, and easy to shote in,
so that they mighte draw bowes of great strength, and shote arrowes of a yarde long.
Captens and officers should be skilful of that most noble weapon, <span class="sidenote">Captains to
see that bows
&amp;c., were in
good order.</span>and to see that
their soldiers according to their draught and strength have good bows, well nocked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
well strynged, everie stringe whippe in their nocke, and in the myddes rubbed with
wax, braser and shuting glove, some spare strings trymed as aforesaid, everie man
one shefe of arrows, with a case of leather defensible against the rayne, <span class="sidenote">Twenty-four
arrows to each
man.</span>and in the
same shefe fower and twentie arrows, whereof eight of them should be lighter than
the residue, to gall and astoyne the enemy with the hailshot of light arrows, before
they shall come within range of their harquebuss shot.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Encouraged
from the
pulpit.</p>

<p>The subject of archery was not deemed, in those days, an unsuitable theme for
the pulpit, as may be seen by the following extract from one of the seven sermons (the
sixth) preached before Edward VI., within the preaching place in the palace of Westminster,
on the 12th of April, 1549, by that patriotic reformer, Bishop Latimer.
With honest, plain spoken words, in the midst of his discourse he breaks <span class="nowrap">off&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Men of England, in times past, when they would exercise themselves, (for we
must needs have some recreation, our bodies can not endure without some exercise),
they were wont to goe abroad in the fieldes a shooting; but now it is turned into
glossing, gulling, and whooring within the house. The arte of shooting hath bene
in times past much esteemed in this realme, it is a gift of God that He hath geven
us to excell all other nations withall, it hath been God&#8217;s instrument whereby He
hath geven us many victories against our enemies. But now we have taken up
whooring in townes, instead of shooting in the fieldes. A wonderous thing that so
excellent a gift of God should be so little esteemed. I desire you, my Lordes, even
as ye love the honour and glory of God, and entend to remove his indignation, let
there be sent forth some proclamation, some sharpe proclamation to the justices of
peace, for they doe not thier dutie, justices now be no justices, there be many good
actes made for this matter already. Charge them upon their allegiance that this
singular benefite of God may be practised, and that it be not turned into bolling,
glossing, and whooring within the townes: for they be negligent in executing these
laws of shooting. <span class="sidenote">Training of
Bishop Latimer.</span>In my time my poore father was as diligent to teach me to shoote
as to learne me any other thing, and so I think other men did their children. He
taught me how to draw, how to lay my body in my bow, and not to draw with
strength of armes as other nations doe, but with strength of the body. I had my
bowes bought me according to my age and strength, as I encreased in them, so my
bowes were made bigger and bigger: for men shall never shoot well except they be
brought up in it. It is a goodly arte, a wholesome kinde of exercise, and much
commended in phisicke.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is another extract from the same <span class="nowrap">sermon:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">How estimated
by the
people.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came once myself to a place, riding on a journey homeward from London,
and I sent word over night into the towne that I would preach there in the morning,
because it was a holiday, and methought it was an holidayes work. The
church stood in my way, and I took my horse and my company, and went thither,
(I thought I should have found a great company in the church,) and when I came
there, the church door was fast locked. I tarryed there halfe an houre and more,
at last the key was found, and one of the parish comes to me and said: &#8216;Sir, this
is a busie day with us, we cannot heare you, it is Robin Hood&#8217;s day. The parish<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
are gone abroad to gather for Robin Hood. I pray you let them not.&#8217; I thought
my rochet should have been regarded, though I were not: but it would not serve,
it was faine to give place to Robin Hood&#8217;s men.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PROOFS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ARCHERY.</h3>

<p>There is little at the present day in England to afford any adequate idea of the
high importance, the great skill, and the distinguished renown of the English archers.
<span class="sidenote">By names of
places.</span>Some few places still retain names which tell where the bowmen used to assemble for
practice, as &#8220;Shooter&#8217;s Hill,&#8221; in Kent; &#8220;Newington Butts,&#8221; near London; and &#8220;St.
Augustine&#8217;s Butts,&#8221; near Bristol. The Butts will be found applied to spots of land in
the vicinity of schools, as for instance, the College School of Warwick.</p>

<p>The fields situated to the east of the playing-fields at Eton, and known by the
name of &#8220;The Upper and Lower Shooting-fields,&#8221; were probably so named from the
ancient exercise of archery on these grounds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Armorial
Bearings.</p>

<p>Many of the noble and county families of Great Britain and Ireland have the
symbols of archery charged on their escutcheons; as, for instance, the Duke of Norfolk,
the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Grey de Wilton, the Earl of Aberdeen, the Earl of
Besborough, the Earl of Portarlington, the Baronetal family of Hales, Sir Martin
Bowes, and also on the arms of Sydney Sussex College, in Cambridge, and the seal of
the Sheffield Grammar School.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Government
brand.</p>

<p>The mark or brand used by the Government of the present day, to identify
public property, is an arrow-head, commonly called &#8220;The King&#8217;s broad arrow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Surnames of
families.</p>

<p>There are also existing families which have derived their surnames from the
names of the different crafts formerly engaged in the manufacture of the bow and its
accompaniments; as, for instance, the names of Bowyer, Fletcher, Stringer, Arrowsmith,
Arrow, Bowman, Bowwater, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sidenote">National
proverbs.</p>

<p>If reference be made to our language, there will be found many phrases and
proverbial expressions drawn from or connected with archery; some suggesting forethought
and caution, as &#8220;Always have two strings to your bow;&#8221; &#8220;Get the shaft-hand
of your adversaries;&#8221; &#8220;Draw not thy bow before thy arrow be fixed;&#8221; &#8220;Kill two
birds with one shaft.&#8221; To make an enemy&#8217;s machination recoil upon himself, they
expressed by saying, &#8220;To outshoot a man in his own bow.&#8221; In reference to a vague
foolish guess, they used to say, &#8220;He shoots wide of the mark;&#8221; and of unprofitable
silly conversation, &#8220;A fool&#8217;s bolt is soon shot;&#8221; and as a proof of exaggeration,
&#8220;He draws a long bow.&#8221; The unready and unskilful archer did not escape the
censure and warning of his fellows, although he might be a great man and boast that
he had &#8220;A famous bow, but it was up at the castle.&#8221; Of such they satirically used
to remark, that &#8220;Many talked of Robin Hood, who never shot in his bow.&#8221; Our
ancestors also expressed liberality of sentiment, and their opinion that merit belonged
exclusively to no particular class or locality, by the following pithy expressions,
&#8220;Many a good bow besides one in Chester,&#8221; and &#8220;An archer is known by his aim,
and not by his arrows.&#8221; To these may be added, &#8220;Testimony is like the shot of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
long-bow, which owes its efficacy to the force of the shooter; argument is like the shot
of a cross-bow, equally forcible, whether discharged by a dwarf or a giant.&#8221;</p>

<h3>MILITARY AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF SKILL IN THE
USE OF THE BOW.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Commenced
at the battle
of Hastings.</p>

<p>From the time of the battle of Hastings the English archers began to rise in
repute, and in course of time proved themselves, by their achievements in war, both
the admiration and terror of their foes, and excelled the exploits of other nations.
<span class="sidenote">Achievement
lasted
through a
period of 500
years.</span>The great achievements of the English bowmen which shed lustre upon the annals of
the nation, extended over a period of more than five centuries, many years after
the invention and use of fire-arms. <span class="sidenote">England had
a voluntary
army.</span>England, therefore, in those times, possessed a
national voluntary militia, of no charge to the Government, ready for the field on a
short notice, and well skilled in the use of weapons. Hence sprung the large
bodies of efficient troops which at different periods of English history, in an incredibly
short time, were found ready for the service of their country. These men were not a
rude, undisciplined rabble, but were trained, disciplined men, every one sufficiently
master of his weapon to riddle a steel corslet at five or six score paces, or in a body,
to act with terrible effect against masses of cavalry; while most of them could bring
down a falcon on the wing by a bird-bolt, or with a broad arrow transfix the wild
deer in the chase.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Archers
defeated men-at-arms.</p>

<p>Before the simple weapon of the British archer, itself but a larger form of the
simplest plaything of a child, all the gorgeous display of knighthood, the elaborated
panoply of steel, the magnificent war-horse, the serried ranks, the ingenious devices of
tacticians and strategists, at once gave way; nothing can withstand the biting storm of
the &#8220;cloth-yard shaft.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Value in
sieges.</span>It was equally efficacious in the field and in the siege. The
defender of town or castle could not peep beyond his bret&egrave;che or parapet, but an
English arrow nailed his cap to his head. In a field, provided the archers were, by
marsh, wood or mountain, secured from a flank attack, they would bid defiance to any
number of mounted men-at-arms. Their shafts, falling thick as hail among the
horses, soon brought them to the ground, or threw them into utter disorder; then the
armed footmen advanced and commenced a slaughter which was scarcely stayed but
by weariness of slaying; the archers meantime continuing their ravages on the rear of
the enemy&#8217;s cavalry by a vertical attack, prolonged, when the ordinary supply of their
quivers had been exhausted, by withdrawing them arrows from their slain enemies, to
be sent forth on new missions of death:&mdash;here is encouragement for our modern
marksmen who are armed with a far more deadly weapon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Opinion on
English
archers by
Napoleon III.</p>

<p>The most complete and philosophic digest, which relates to the system of
British archery, considered from a military point of view, is that given by the present
Emperor of the French in his treatise &#8220;<i>Sur le Pass&eacute; et l&#8217;Avenir de l&#8217;Artillerie</i>.&#8221; That
the British victory at Cressy was wholly attributable to the prowess of British archers,
is well known; not so well, a circumstance pointed out by the Emperor of the French,
that thenceforward, and in consequence of that victory, <span class="sidenote">Destroyed the
prestige of
cavalry.</span>the prestige of cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
declined. Now, there is a political, no less than military significance in this lowering
of the esteem in which cavalry had previously been held. Horsemen were gentlemen,
and infantry men of inferior degree. Whenever and wherever British archery were
<i>not</i> brought to bear, horsemen were omnipotent, and infantry of little avail. <span class="sidenote">Estimation of
infantry by
continental
nations.</span>During
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries&mdash;the golden age of archery in this land, when
yeomen or archers were in such high repute,&mdash;France and continental nations generally,
treated foot soldiers with disdain. The Emperor of the French, in his
systematic book just adverted to, mentions several examples where foot soldiers were
ruthlessly cut down and ridden over by their own cavalry&mdash;the men-at-arms; not
that the infantry fought ill, but that they fought too well. They were slaughtered
lest the men-at-arms should have no scope for the exercise of their skill.</p>

<p>English men-at-arms never sullied their fame by cruel acts like these; not that
they were better at heart: seeing that human nature is everywhere, and under all circumstances,
pretty much alike. English infantry, mainly composed of archers, were
far too valuable to be thus used. They bore the first brunt of battle, and not unfrequently
decided it. At the time when every other foot soldier in Europe was the
merest serf, <span class="sidenote">Archer a
yeoman.</span>the British archer was a yeoman. He had a fixed heraldic rank; the first
of low degree. He was above the handicraftsman, however skilful,&mdash;above the
merchant&mdash;taking his rank immediately after the gentry. <span class="sidenote">Political
results.</span>The excellence of British
archery, then tended to bring about a political result; helping to establish that middle-class
which, ever since its consolidation, has been one of the sheet-anchors of our
glorious constitution.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>THE ARBALEST, OR CROSS-BOW.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bow,
modification
of long.</p>

<p>In process of time a modification of the bow was invented. In place of the
original instrument, a much shorter and stiffer bow, usually of steel, was placed
transversely in a stock, bent by a lever, and discharged by a trigger, after the manner
since used for a gun.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Invented in
Crete or
Sicily.</p>

<p>The cross-bow, or arbalest, called in Latin, arcus balistarius, or balista manualis,
and in French arbal&egrave;t, is said by some to be of Sicilian origin; others ascribe its
invention to the Cretans. It is supposed to have been introduced into France by the
first crusaders, and is mentioned by the Abb&eacute; Suger in his life of Louis le Gros, as
being used by that Prince, in the beginning of his reign, which commenced in the
year 1108.</p>

<p class="sidenote">To England
by Saxons.</p>

<p>Verstigan seems to attribute the introduction of this weapon into England to the
Saxons, under Hengist and Horsa, but cites no authority in support of that supposition.
In a print representing the landing of those generals, the foremost of them is
delineated with a cross-bow on his shoulder, and others are seen in the hands of the
distant figures of their followers, landed and landing from their ships.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Normans
got cross-bows
from
Italy.</p>

<p>It would appear that the Normans derived the cross-bow, with its name, from
Italy. In Domesday Book mention is made of Odo, the arbalester, as a tenant in
capite of the king of lands in Yorkshire; and the manor of Worstead, Norfolk, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
at the time of Domesday survey, held of the Abbot of St. Benet at Holme, by
Robert the cross-bow man. The names show them to have been Normans, and these
instances are sufficient to prove the introduction of the weapon, though the few that
may have been used at the battle of Hastings might occasion its not being represented
in the Bayeux tapestry.</p>

<p class="sidenote">No cross-bow
among
Romans.</p>

<p>The absence of the cross-bow in early Roman monuments leaves it a matter of
doubt, whether an arbalester would not simply mean the engineer of a catapult.
There is no mention made of the hand cross-bow in very ancient authorities.</p>

<p class="sidenote">William II
surnamed
Rufus, from
1087 to 1100</p>

<p>The cross-bow has been used in England (at least, on hunting excursions) in the
time of Rufus, for Wace tells us, that &#8220;Prince Henry, going the same day to New
Forest, found the string of his cross-bow broken, and taking it to a villain to be
mended, saw an old woman there, who told him he should be king.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Henry I, 1100
to 1135.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry I. the cross-bow seems to have been principally used
in the chase. The projectile was in form of a short arrow, with a pyramidical head,
called a quarrel, (<a href="#Plate14">plate 14</a>, fig. 2 and 4). <span class="sidenote">Cross-bow in
war.</span>Simeon of Durham speaks of it in the
time of Henry I. thus:&mdash;&#8220;He raised a machine from whence the archers and cross-bowmen
might shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Genoese

the use of.</p>

<p>The Genoese were at all times most celebrated for the skilful management of the
cross-bow. The success which attended the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem,
1100, is attributed principally to the mechanical talents of this people.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Use of forbad.</p>

<p>The use of the cross-bows was general in Italy in 1139, for at that time Pope
Innocent II. particularly forbad them. The German Emperor Conrad did the same,
as we learn from William de Dole, who lived in the latter part of the 12th century,
they not being looked upon as a fair weapon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Richard I
from 1189 to
1199.</p>

<p>It is said of Richard I.:&mdash;&#8220;Truly he revived the use of this kind of shooting,
called cross-bow shooting, which had long since been laid aside, whence he became
so skilful in its management, that he killed many people with his own hand.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Siege of Acre</span>It is
supposed that Richard I. first used the cross-bow as a weapon of war at the siege of
Acre. <span class="sidenote">Universal in
Crusades.</span>In every action, however, of which we read in the history of the second
crusade, as well as the third, in which Richard participated, cross-bows, as well as
other bows, are repeatedly noticed. <span class="sidenote">Richard
killed by.</span>It is stated that he was killed by an arrow, said
to have been shot from a cross-bow at the Castle of Chaluz.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Genoese
cross-bow
men.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the 13th, and until the middle of the 15th century, cross-bow
men are uniformly mentioned as part of the Genoese troops. From Justinius we
learn, that in 1225 <span class="sidenote">Mounted
Arbalists
1225.</span>&#8220;Twenty Arbalestes mounted, and one hundred on foot, with
cross-bows of horn, were then employed in the army of the state.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cross-bow man was an essential component of the host during all this period.
He was in the van of the battle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Battle near
Damietta
1237.</p>

<p>In the battle near Damietta, in 1237, &#8220;more than a hundred knights of the
Temple fell, and three hundred cross-bow men, &amp;c., &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Campaign in
Italy 1239.</p>

<p>The Emperor Frederic, in 1239, giving an account of his Italian campaign to the
king of England, writes: &#8220;After we had, by our knights and cross-bow men, reduced
all the province of Liguria,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Genoese 1245.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span></p>

<p>Five hundred Genoese cross-bow men were sent against the Milanese in 1245,
and these unfortunate men being placed in front of the line, were taken prisoners by
the enemy, who, to revenge themselves for the havoc done by their bows, <span class="sidenote">Treatment of.</span>cruelly

They were not bound to serve beyond the limits of their district without the consent
of the Provost of Paris. There were both foot and mounted cross-bowmen in this
body.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bow
encouraged
by Edward

<p>Edward III., though he wished principally to encourage the long-bow, could not
help seeing the advantages which might be derived from the cross-bow, from the
accuracy of its shot, and its convenience on horseback. <span class="sidenote">No English

the long wars of Edward with the French in this century, cross-bowmen were raised
in England, <span class="sidenote">Genoese

for service at sea. In 1363 the king caused public proclamation to be made, in order
to encourage its use.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Matches.</p>

<p>There were also matches made in different parts of Europe, at which prizes were

<p>In the list of the Grand Masters of the Arbalesters of France under Charles V.,

both foot and horse, in the service of the king.&#8221; And a similar notice occurs in the
reign of King John, Baudoin de Lence being Grand Master; but it would appear
that the mounted cross-bowmen were retained in much smaller numbers than the foot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">&#8220;Pavisers.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the reign of Edward III. cross-bowmen seem first to have been protected
by &#8220;Pavisers,&#8221; (<a href="#Plate15">plate 15</a>), or men who held before them a large shield called a
&#8220;Pavise.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Pavisers by

<p>On the attack by the French and Spaniards upon the Isle of Portland in 1404,
the English formed pavisers to protect themselves from the cross-bow bolts, by taking
the doors from their houses, and fixing them upright by props. Under this cover the
archers plied their arrows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bow

by English.</p>

<p>The English never had much esteem for the cross-bow in the field. Among the

Arbalesters, of whom eighteen were horsemen; <span class="sidenote">Forbad by

necessary to prohibit the use of the cross-bow in 1508, and, seven years after, another

legislature does not seem to have produced the intended effect, for in less than twenty
years later the use of the cross-bow had become so prevalent, <span class="sidenote">Forbad by

judged requisite, which inflicted on every person that kept one in his house, the

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF CROSS-BOW.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Description.</p>

<p>The ancient cross-bow, which differed in many particulars from those of late
times, is thus described by Father Daniel, who formed his description from one or
more then before him.</p>

<p>The cross-bow was an offensive weapon, which consisted of a bow fixed to the
top of a sort of staff, or stock of wood, which the string of the bow, when unbent,
crossed at right angles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Stock.</p>

<p>The handle or bed, which was called the stock of the cross-bow, had towards the
middle a small opening or slit, of the length of two fingers, in which was a little
moveable wheel of solid steel; through the centre of it passed a screw that served for
an axis; this wheel projected a little beyond the surface of the stock, and had a notch,
or catch, which stopped and held the string of the bow when bent. <span class="sidenote">Trigger.</span>In the opposite
side of the circumference was a much smaller notch, by the means of which the spring
of the trigger kept the wheel firmer, and in its place; this wheel is called the nut of
the cross-bow. Under the stock, near the handle, was the key of the trigger, like that
of the serpentine of a musket; by pressing this key with the hand, to the
handle of the cross-bow, the spring released the wheel that held the string, and the
string by its motion drove forward the dart.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Back-sight.</p>

<p>Upon the stock below the little wheel was a small plate of copper, which lifted
up and shut down, and was fixed by its two legs, with two screws to the two sides of
the stock; this was a back-sight; it was pierced above by two little holes, one over
the other, and when the plate was raised, these two holes answered to a <span class="sidenote">Fore-sight.</span>globule, which
was a small bead, no bigger than that of a chaplet, that was suspended at the end of
the cross-bow by a fine wire, and fastened to two perpendicular columns of iron, one on
the right, the other on the left, and this little globule, answering to the holes in the
plate, served to direct the aim, whether for shooting horizontally, upwards, or
downwards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cord.</p>

<p>The cord or string of the bow was double, each string separated by two little
cylinders of iron, equi-distant from the extremities of the bow and the centre; to these
two strings in the middle was fixed a ring of cord, which served to confine it in the
notch previously mentioned when the bow was bent. Between the two cords in the centre
of the string, and immediately before the ring, was a little square of cord, against
which was placed the extremity of the arrow or dart, to be pushed forward by
the cord.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bent by hand.</p>

<p>The smaller cross-bows were bent with the hand; <span class="sidenote">By foot</span>the larger ones were at first
bent by the soldier placing his foot in a stirrup, attached to the end of the bow; a cord<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
was then fixed by one end to the butt of the stock, the other end being fastened to a
waistbelt. <span class="sidenote">By pulley.</span>A pulley, running upon the cord, was hooked to the bowstring, and the
bow was then bent by raising the body and keeping the leg firm.</p>

<p class="sidenote">By moulinet.</p>

<p>The cross-bow was afterwards furnished with the moulinet and pulleys, (<a href="#Plate13">plate 13</a>)
which after the bow had been bent, could be removed for the discharge; these consisted
of an iron cylinder in a frame of the same metal, made to turn by two moveable
handles in opposite directions, and having a cap likewise of iron to fit on the butt end
of the stock. On each side of this cap was a small pulley, the wheel of which was one
inch and a half in diameter, having attached to one of its arms a strong cord that
passed thence round an equal sized wheel, returned over the first, and then went round
one double in diameter, situated beyond the second, and so passed to the cylinder of
the moulinet, by winding which, the power required to bend the bow was lessened to
one fourth. Attached to the arms of the greater wheels was a double claw, made to
slide on the plane of the stock, which, catching hold of the bowstring, drew it up to
the nut. An improvement of the moulinet was, that the handles of the cylinder were
both made in the same line, instead of being one up and the other down.</p>

<p class="sidenote">By windlass.</p>

<p>At a later period the cross-bow was bent by a windlass, which consisted of a bar
of iron, shaped at its end into a claw, and having teeth the whole length of one edge.
This slipped through an iron box, containing a wheel, the cogs of which fitted the
teeth of the bar, and as a handle was fixed to the axle, on turning it the string was
wound up. This apparatus was attached by a loop, which slipped over the stock,
and was kept in its place by two iron pins, that projected from the side, and then,
when bent, it could be easily removed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">By steel lever.</p>

<p>Another mode of bending the cross-bow was by means of a steel lever, called
the goat&#8217;s-foot lever, which was moveable. This was formed of two legs, a catch
and a handle, all acting on one pivot. The legs were applied to the projecting pieces
of iron on each side the stock, and then the purchase was very great.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Latch.</p>

<p>There were two principal varieties of cross-bows, viz., the &#8220;Latch,&#8221; with grooved
stock, for &#8220;quarrels,&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Prodd.</span>and the &#8220;Prodd,&#8221; for bullets.
(<a href="#Plate14">Plate 14</a>, fig. 1 and 2.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dimensions
and form of
latch.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VI. the stocks of cross-bows were made of hard wood,
ornamented with ivory. They were about three feet three inches long, the bow of
steel, about two feet eight inches from end to end, weighing in all about fifteen
pounds. The length of the groove for the quarrel about one foot four inches. <span class="sidenote">Quarrels viretons.</span>The
arrows discharged were called both quarrels and viretons, (<a href="#Plate14">plate 14</a>, fig. 2 and 4,)
some with feathers, others without. The vireton is a French name; the feathers
being set on a little curved, made it spin round as it passed through the air.</p>

<p>It is stated by Captain Pan&ocirc;t, that the Arquebus was in use before the invention
of powder, and was but an improvement on the arbalest, or cross-bow. <span class="sidenote">Arquebus or
barrelled
cross-bow.</span>The
Arquebus, like the cross-bow, had a stock, upon which was fixed a tube, intended
to receive the projectile. <span class="sidenote">Slit in tube.</span>This tube was split, for the passage of a cord, which was
held back by a kind of sheave or pulley, which communicated motion to the projectile,
on the trigger being pulled. <span class="sidenote">Fired leaden
balls.</span>In general, leaden balls were fired from the
arquebus. The barrelled cross-bow was suggested by the &#8220;balista grossa de arganellis,&#8221;
which was furnished with tubes for ejecting Greek fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Repeating
cross-bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span></p>

<p>In the United Service Museum, Whitehall, there is a cross-bow of Cingalese
manufacture. It strings itself, and discharges two arrows each time in rapid succession,
until the magazine is exhausted, which contains twelve arrows, and may be
replenished in a moment.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Range in
Henry V.</p>

<p>It is evident that the different sizes and various powers of cross-bows occasioned
a great diversity in the distance of their range. Thus, in Henry 5th&#8217;s time the range
of the cross-bow is stated to have been forty rods (220 yards), and it never appears
to have been more powerful than at that period.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Range in
Elizabeth&#8217;s.</p>

<p>M. de Bellay says that the cross-bowman will kill at 100 or 200 paces, which
gives a great range to the arbalests of Elizabeth&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>Sir John Smith, however, in his observations, not long after this, very much
contracts the distance of their shot, for he says that &#8220;a cross-bow will kill point-blank
between 40 and 60 yards, and, if elevated, 120, 140, or 160 yards, or further.&#8221;</p>

<p>The former probably alluded to the prod, the latter to the latch.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>COMPARATIVE MERITS OF THE LONG AND CROSS BOW.</h3>

<p>How inefficient the cross-bow was found, when opposed by English archery,
appears in every page of the histories of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Why long-bow
superior.</p>

<p>The superiority of the long-bow mainly depended upon the strength and skill of
the archer, while a greater amount of accuracy at shorter ranges could be had out of
the cross-bow, with much less training; and the success of the English archers when
opposed to cross-bowmen may be mainly ascribed to the more &#8220;rapid&#8221; fire of the
former.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Celerity the
great advantage
of the
long-bow.</p>

<p>It is generally conceded that the long-bow could deliver at least six shafts while
the cross-bow discharged one; and, &#8220;with such odds against them, it became impossible
for the bravest and most expert troops, whether at Cressy or elsewhere, to make
a stand against their opponents&#8221;.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bow
best on horseback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the cross-bow was decidedly a more convenient weapon on
horseback than the long-bow.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>COMPARATIVE MERITS BETWEEN BOWS AND EARLY
FIRE-ARMS.</h3>

<p>The invention of gunpowder, and its application to artillery and small arms, did
not produce that sudden change in the art of war, or in weapons, that might, on a
first consideration, have been expected. Many of the old soldiers were much divided
in their opinion of the superiority of fire-arms, nor does it appear that the government
of those days were decided upon it, as the strongest statutes for enforcing the practice
of archery were enacted after their introduction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Long-bow
preferred in
Edward III.</p>

<p>Joshua Barnes, in his life of Edward III., observes, that &#8220;without all question,
the guns which are used now-a-days, are neither so terrible in battle nor do such execution
nor work such confusion as arrows can do; for bullets, being not seen, only hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
where they hit, but arrows enrage the horse, and break the array, and terrify all that
behold them in the bodies of their neighbours. Not to say that every archer can shoot
thrice to a gunner&#8217;s once, and that whole squadrons of bows may let fly at one time,
when only one or two files of musqueteers can discharge at once. Also, that whereas
guns are useless when your pikes join, because they only do execution point-blank, the
arrows which will kill at random may do good service even behind your men of arms.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Long-bow the
favourite in
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Although fire-arms had attained no inconsiderable degree of perfection in the
reign of Henry VIII., yet the long-bow was still the favourite weapon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Merits balanced
in Queen
Mary&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p>So indifferent were the ministers of Queen Mary respecting them, that in her
ordinance respecting armour and weapons, the alternative is left to the choice of the
people, whether they should find a long-bow and sheaf of arrows, or a haquebutt, in
every case where they were by law charged with the latter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The lighter
ammunition
of the harquebus
an advantage.</p>

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, the musket was so slow to charge and discharge that
the bow was considered superior by many; and Mons. de Bellay states that if archers
and cross-bowmen could carry their arrows, &amp;c., as easy as harquebusiers do their
ammunition, he would prefer the former weapon over the latter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrows make
more severe
wounds than
bullets.</p>

<p>The effects of arrows sticking in horses, are said to have been frightful. This
can be easily imagined. A fire-arm bullet can be shot quite through a horse without
causing the animal to show one sign of anguish. He goes steadily on his previous
course, and makes no sign. However fatal of necessity, a fire-arm bullet gives no
immediate pain. Not so the arrow. Planted never so lightly in a horse&#8217;s neck or flank,
the animal grew furious. Starting off into a wild gallop to escape the barbed sting,
the animal had no respite for his agony. The wilder the pace, the greater the pain.
Far from the serried squadrons where he fain would be, sore against his will, rushed
the mail-clad knight. Plunging and rearing, the steed would throw him at last,
amidst the dead and dying; himself to die.</p>

<p>Though comparatively few men or horses were killed by arrow wounds at once,
few, nevertheless, recovered. The barbed arrow-head was immeasurably more dangerous,
imbedded in the flesh, than a mere lump of lead. Hundreds of men, hale and
well to-day, have had fire-arm bullets imbedded in their flesh for years. Not so in the
time of archery. The arrow-head must be extracted, or mortification came on, and
soon a cruel death. Neither was the surgical process of extraction often happy in the
results. It would not be easy to extract a barbed arrow-head even now, with all the
appliances of modern surgery at hand.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrow
wounds more
fatal.</p>

<p>Another fatal consequence of arrow wounds on the field of battle was this: men
wounded thus were rarely taken prisoners. Arrows were expensive ammunition.
The battle over, detachments were sent out to collect them; and the collection was
not done too tenderly. To regain an arrow seemed a far more meritorious act than
to save the life of an enemy. The throat of many a wounded wretch was mercilessly
cut, that he might be quiet whilst the arrow was being extracted.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bows useless
in wind.</p>

<p>The defects of archery were these:&mdash;the ammunition was expensive, and when
lost, not easily replaced. The flight of arrows is never correct on a windy day, from
whatever direction the wind may blow. <span class="sidenote">In rain.</span>Rain
relaxes the bow and bowstring, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
archery then is of little use. All these are serious defects; but there was another of
more importance still. When the archer&#8217;s ammunition was all expended, he was
nearly powerless. A sword, indeed, he carried, for close fighting; and each archer
stuck into the ground before him a sharp pointed stake as a protection against cavalry.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hand-gun
most penetration.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Silent discharge
in
favor of bows.</p>

<p>The great advantage of the hand-gun was from its penetration, as no armour could
keep out balls, but the <i>silent</i> discharge of the cross-bow rendered it superior in the
pursuit of timid animals, and the prodd has continued in use to the present day, for
the purpose of killing deer, rooks, and rabbits.</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF ARTILLERY.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p>There is no subject more intimately connected with the history of the world, from
the remotest antiquity than the history of Arms, <span class="sidenote">Fate of nations
depends
on arms.</span>the fate of nations having always
depended either on the superiority of the Arms employed, or on the superior discipline
or dexterity of those who used them, wholly independent of the numbers by which
they were opposed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Artillery includes
all war-engines.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of gunpowder, all kinds of weapons, both offensive and
defensive, were included in the term &#8220;Artillery,&#8221; which has since become restricted
to the larger kinds of fire-arms, such as guns, mortars, howitzers, rockets, &amp;c. Thus
we find in the I. Saml. xx., 40, &#8220;And Jonathan gave his artillery to his lad,&#8221; when
speaking of bows and arrows. Again, in the 20th, Henry VIII., a patent was granted
to Anthony Knevt and Peter Mentas, &#8220;to be overseers of the science of Artillery;&#8221;
and in an enumeration of the different species of Artillery, printed in 1594, are
reckoned &#8220;long-bows, cross-bows, slur-bows, stone-bows, scorpions, and catapultas.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Definition of
Artillery.</p>

<p>The root of the word &#8220;artillery,&#8221; is the Latin word &#8220;<i>ars</i>,&#8221; an &#8220;art.&#8221; It has
been fantastically derived from the Italian <i>arte di tirare</i>, the art of firing. In the
fourteenth century the science of war-engines was called <i>artemonie</i>, and its productions
<i>artillerie</i>, from the old French word <i>artiller</i>, &#8220;to employ art.&#8221; Some writers state that
the word &#8220;artillery,&#8221; is derived from <i>arcus</i> &#8220;a bow,&#8221; the earlier species of artillery
being termed <i>arcualia</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First invention
unknown.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy the epoch at which gunpowder
and its resultants, fire-arms, were first employed for the purposes of war in any
part of the world; and this difficulty is increased, at least, as far as regards Europe,
from the fact, <span class="sidenote">Names of gun&mdash;from
old machines.</span>that the first engines of war, depending on the use of gunpowder, were
named after the old machines for throwing darts, stones, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sidenote">First mention
of guns.</p>

<p>The earliest account which we have of gunpowder, where it is mentioned as
applied to fire-arms, exists in a code of Gentoo Laws, and is thought by many to be
coeval with the time of Moses. The notice occurs in the Sanscrit preface to the Code
of Gentoo Laws, translated by Halhed, at page 53, viz:&mdash;&#8220;The Magistrate shall not
make war with any deceitful machine, or with poisoned weapons, or with <i>cannon or
guns</i>, &amp;c.&#8221; Halhed observes: &#8220;It will no doubt strike the reader with wonder to
find a prohibition of fire-arms in records of such unfathomable antiquity, and he will
probably hence renew the suspicion, which has long been deemed absurd, that
Alexander the Great did absolutely meet with some weapons of this kind in India,
as a passage in Quintus Curtius seems to ascertain.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Greek fire,
earliest European
combustible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span></p>

<p>The Greek fire seems to have been one of the earliest attempts in Europe at the
manufacture of a military combustible; <span class="sidenote">Gunpowder
known before
in China.</span>but there is some reason to believe that the
Chinese had become acquainted with the nature of gunpowder long before the introduction
or invention of the aforenamed substance; and they appear to have been the
first who took any steps in its manufacture, or in that of weapons of war resulting
from its use. Amongst the machines constructed by this extraordinary people, was
one called &#8220;the thunder of the earth,&#8221; which is thus described by M. Reinaud; and
M. Fav&eacute;: <span class="sidenote">Chinese explosive
shell.</span>&#8220;A hollow globe of iron was filled with a bucket of gunpowder, mixed
with fragments of metal, and was so arranged, that it exploded on the approach of
an enemy, so as to cause great destruction in his ranks.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Early Chinese
cannon.</span>The &#8220;impetuous&#8221; dart of the
Chinese, was a round bamboo, about two and a half feet in length, lashed with hempen
cords to prevent its splitting, and having a strong wooden handle fixed to one end,
thus making its entire length about five feet. This was then charged with powder
of different kinds, arranged in layers, over which were placed fire balls, which being
thrown to a distance of thirty or forty yards by the discharge, consumed any combustible
materials they might come in contact with.</p>

<p>A late writer, M. Paravey, has in a great measure established the fact, that gunpowder
and fire-arms were known to the Chinese long before the Christian era; and
it is mentioned in Chinese writings, <span class="sidenote">Guns in China,
618 B.&nbsp;C.</span>that in the year 618 <span class="smcapall">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, a gun was in use,
bearing this inscription, &#8220;I hurl death to the traitor, and extermination to the rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">A.&nbsp;D. 757.</p>

<p>Guns are said to have been constructed in China, in 757 <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, for the purpose of
throwing stones of the weight of from ten to fourteen pounds to a distance of 300
paces. Whatever doubts may exist as to the earlier history of artillery among the
Chinese, it is almost beyond question, that cannon were extensively used by them in
the beginning of the 13th century, as we have access to various reliable accounts,
establishing this fact.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Artillery at
Saragossa,
A.&nbsp;D., 1118.</p>

<p>Cond&eacute;, in his history of the Moors in Spain, states that artillery was used by
them against Saragossa in 1118 <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, <span class="sidenote">At Niebla,
A.&nbsp;D., 1157.</span>and that in 1157, <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span> they defended themselves
in Niebla, against the Spaniards, by means of machines, which threw darts and
stones, through the agency of fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Used against
the Moguls,
A.&nbsp;D. 1232.</p>

<p>In 1232 <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span> cannon throwing stone shot were used against the Moguls, and
during this war, certain machines were also employed, which being filled with powder,
and ignited at the proper time, burst with a noise like thunder, and whose effect
extended for the space of half an acre round the spot where they exploded.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon bearing
date 1258
found in
France.</p>

<p>A small brass cannon is said to have been found at the bottom of a deep well of
the Castle de Clucy, in France, with the date 1258 upon it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon used
against Cordova,
A.&nbsp;D.
1280.</p>

<p>In 1280 <span class="smcapall">A.&nbsp;D.</span>, cannon were used against Cordova, after which period, they are
frequently mentioned in the records of Spain. <span class="sidenote">Iron shot, 14th

used in that country in the beginning of the 14th century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon used
by Arabians,

<p>Cannon are described by Arabian authors as early as 1312.</p>

<p>The first mention we have of the use of fire arms, after this period, is in the life
of Robert Bruce, by John Barbour, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, in which certain engines
termed, &#8220;crakeys of war,&#8221; are spoken of, as having been used by Edward III., in his
campaign against the Scots, in 1327.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon in
France, 1338.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span></p>

<p>It is generally believed that cannon were commonly employed in Europe since
1338, as they were used by the French in that year to demolish some castles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Siege of
Algesiras,
1342 to 1344.</p>

<p>Gunpowder is said to have been used at the siege of Algesiras by Alphonse of
Castile against the Moors, 1342 to 1344.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon at
Cressy, 1346.</p>

<p>Edward III. had four guns at the battle of Cressy, 1346. Froissart mentions
these guns in one of his manuscripts, now preserved in the library of Amiens. A free
translation of the passage referred to would run as follows: &#8220;And the English caused
to fire suddenly certain guns which they had in the battle, to astonish (or confound)
the Genoese.&#8221; Vilani, a Florentine historian, also confirms this statement, as well
as a passage in the chronicles of St. Denis, which speaks of the use of cannon by the
English at Cressy. An ancient manuscript also mentions the existence of gunners and
artillerymen, whom Edward III. employed when he landed before Calais in 1346,
and the several stipends each soldier received. The sentence runs thus: &#8220;Masons,
carpenters, engineers, gunners, and artillerymen, the sum of 12, 10, 6, and 3
pence per diem.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon of two
kinds.</p>

<p>The first fire-arms appear to have consisted of two kinds; a larger one for discharging
stones, called a bombard, (<a href="#Plate18">plate 18</a>, fig. 3) and a smaller for propelling
darts and leaden balls, <span class="sidenote">Used by the
Black Prince,
1356.</span>both of which were used in 1356, by the Black Prince, to
reduce the castle of Romozantin; <span class="sidenote">At St. Valery,
1358.</span>and two years later, the artillery of St. Valery did
great execution among its besiegers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon made
in England,
1377</p>

<p>Cannon were made in England in the fourteenth century, and Richard II. commissioned
Sir Thomas Norwich to buy two great and two small cannon in London, or
in any other place; and also 600 balls of stone for cannon and for other engines, to
be sent to the Castle of Bristol.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon at St.
Malo.</p>

<p>When the English unsuccessfully besieged St. Malo, 400 cannon are said to have
been used, but these are supposed to have been of the smaller kind, called hand
cannon, or culverins, which were carried by two men, and fired from a kind of
tripod or rest fixed in the ground.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon
general.</p>

<p>From this period, cannon were used in all the offensive and defensive operations
of war; though a considerable time elapsed before it became a really serviceable arm
for field operations. The earlier kinds of cannon were called bombards or bombard&aelig;.
Those first employed were clumsy, (<a href="#Plate16">plate 16</a>) and ill contrived, wider at the mouth
than at the chamber. <span class="sidenote">Bombards
made of iron.</span>They merely consisted of bars of iron, arranged in such a
manner that their internal aspects should form a tube. The bars were not welded
together, but merely confined by hoops. They were also made of iron bars over a
cylinder of copper, strengthened by iron hoops, driven on red hot, and others were
entirely composed of copper. <span class="sidenote">Bronze.</span>Bronze was also employed in the manufacture of
artillery, as well as thin sheets of iron rolled together; <span class="sidenote">Leather, rope,
&amp;c.</span>and guns made of leather, and
coiled rope, over a cylinder of copper or gun metal, were also introduced, and continued
in use for a considerable time. <span class="sidenote">Wood.</span>Guns also appear to have been made of wood.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rope mortar
at Venice.</p>

<p>In the arsenal at Venice there is an ancient mortar, constructed of leather and
rope, used in the siege of the island of Chioggia, near Venice, against the Genoese,
1380. The shot is of stone, 14in. in diameter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon of
paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<p>It has been heard recently, that the Chinese constructed their cannon of prepared
paper, lined with copper.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Field cannon
to keep up
with army,
1380.</p>

<p>As early as 1380 it is said the French were able to procure for the invasion of
Italy, a great number of brass cannon, mounted on carriages, and drawn by horses,
instead of oxen; these pieces threw balls of from 40lbs. to 60lbs. in weight and could
always keep pace with the army. (<a href="#Plate18">Plate 18</a>, fig. 1, 3, and 4.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Large cannon
1400.</p>

<p>A cannon taken at the siege of Dien in 1546, by John de Castro, and now in
Lisbon, is 20 feet 7in. in length, 6 feet 3in. in diameter in the middle, and threw a
ball of 100lbs. A Hindostani inscription on it states that it was cast in 1400.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bolts and
quarrels shot,
1413.</p>

<p>Bolts and quarrels were shot from cannon in the reign of Henry V.; these were
succeeded by stones, as he ordered in 1418, &#8220;labourers to make 7,000 stones for the
guns of different sorts from the quarries of Maidstone.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Red-hot iron
balls used at
Cherbourg,
1418.</span>We learn from Elam&#8217;s life of
Henry V., that when an English army, commanded by the Duke of Gloucester,
besieged Cherbourg in 1418, the besieged discharged <i>red-hot</i> balls of <i>iron</i> from their
cannon into the English camp, to burn the huts. <span class="sidenote">Slow to discharge.</span>So much time elapsed between the
loading and discharging the great guns, that the besieged had sufficient time to repair
at their leisure, the breaches made by the enormous stones, &amp;c., thrown from them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon at
Meaux, 1422.</p>

<p>Five wrought-iron bombards are preserved in the &#8220;Mus&eacute;e de l&#8217;Artillerie,&#8221; at Paris;
which were, it is said, abandoned by the English, at the town of Meaux, in 1422.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon cast,
1450.</p>

<p>About the middle of the fifteenth century, the ancient method of constructing
cannon was exchanged for that of casting. A hard or mixed metal was invented
called &#8220;font metal&#8221; or bronze, and cannon were then cast in one piece, and instead of
fanciful names, they began to be indicated by the weight of their ball, as at present.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Siege of Constantinople,
1453.</p>





<p>At the siege of Constantinople, by Mahomet II., stones were thrown weighing
1,200lbs.! The cannon employed could not be discharged more than three or four
times a day. This siege was distinguished by the re-union of ancient and modern
artillery; <span class="sidenote">Small guns
with several
barrels.</span>the small arms of the Christians discharged five, or even ten balls at the
same time, as large as walnuts; and one piece made for the Turks, by Urban, a Dane,
cast a stone bullet weighing 600lbs., which could be discharged seven times a day,
but it ultimately burst. <span class="sidenote">Large brass
gun, cast at
Adrianople.</span>This gun was cast of brass at Adrianople, of stupendous and
almost incredible magnitude; twelve palms is assigned to the bore. A vacant space
before the palace was chosen for the first experiment, but to prevent the sudden and
mischievous effects of astonishment and fear, a proclamation was issued that the cannon
would be discharged on the following day. The explosion was felt or heard in a
circuit of 100 furlongs, the ball was driven above a mile and buried itself a fathom in
the ground. A carriage of thirty waggons was linked together to carry the gun along, and
drawn by a team of sixty oxen; 200 men on both sides were stationed to poise or
sustain the rolling weight, 250 workmen marched before it to smooth the way, and
repair the bridges, and near two months were employed in a laborious journey of 150
miles. This enormous gun was flanked by two of almost equal magnitude, and fourteen
batteries, mounting 130 guns, were brought to bear upon the place. The cannon
were intermingled with machines for throwing stones and darts.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Artillery of
Scots 1496.</p>

<p>The Scots had a kind of artillery peculiar to themselves, called
&#8220;Carts of War.<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>&#8221;
They are described in an Act of Parliament, thus &#8220;ilk Cart twa gunnis and ilk ane
to have twa Chalmers and an Cumrand man to shute theme.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Breech-loaders.</span>These were breech-loaders,
and in 1471, the Barons were commanded to provide such &#8220;Carts of War&#8221;
against their old enemies the English. (<a href="#Plate18">Plate 18</a>, fig. 1.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannon
named.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon to give strange names to early cannon; thus Louis XII.
had twelve brass ones cast in 1503, of enormous size, which he named after the twelve
Peers of France; the Spaniards and Portugese christened theirs after their Saints,
and the Emperor Charles V. had twelve when he went against Tunis, which he named
after the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cause of improvements.</p>

<p>As a knowledge of the art of gunnery increased, great improvements took place
with regard to projectiles; <span class="sidenote">Iron balls in
England, 15th
century.</span>and balls of iron were substituted in the place of those
formed of stone, being introduced into England in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Iron guns cast.</p>

<p>Iron guns were not cast in this country until the year 1547, foreigners being
generally employed to manufacture them. Both Henry VII. and Henry VIII. took
great pains to introduce the art of gunnery into the kingdom; and to this end, had a
number of Flemish gunners in their daily pay; in fact, it is said, that the latter
monarch himself, invented small pieces of artillery to defend his waggons. <span class="sidenote">Hand-culverines.</span>The earlier
species of field artillery, embraced among others, a small kind of ordnance called,
&#8220;hand cannon,&#8221; or culverins, which were so light and portable, that they could be carried
and served by two men; they were fired from a rest, placed on the ground; <span class="sidenote">Organ-guns.</span>also
&#8220;ribandequins&#8221; or organ guns; these latter consisted of a number of tubes, placed in
a row, like those of an organ, and appear to have been of French origin, as were many
of the improvements which took place about that period, including the invention of
wall pieces, throwing leaden balls of ten to the pound.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mortars,
Henry VIII.</p>

<p>For mortars we are indebted to workmen of Henry VIII. as &#8220;one Peter Bawd
and one Peter Vancollen, both the king&#8217;s feed men, devised and caused to be made
certain mortar pieces, being at the mouth from eleven to nineteen inches wide, <span class="sidenote">Shells.</span>and
also certain hollow shot of cast iron, to be stuffed with fire-work or wild-fire, for to
break in pieces the same hollow shot.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Varieties of
cannon.</span>And in the first year of Edward VI. the said
Peter Bawd did make ordnance of iron of divers forms, as fawconet, fawkons, minions,
sakers, &amp;c. His servant, J. Johnson, did like make and cast iron ordnance cleaner and
to better perfection, to the great use of this land. His son Thomas Johnson, in 1593,
made forty two cast pieces of great ordnance for the Earl of Cumberland, demi cannon,
weighing 5,000lbs. or three tons the piece. <span class="sidenote">Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
Pocket-pistol.</span>At Dover there is a culverine, presented
to Queen Elizabeth, by the States General of Holland, and called Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
Pocket-pistol. It is 24 feet long, diameter of bore 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, weight of shot 12lbs.;
it was manufactured in 1544, and is mounted on an ornamented iron carriage made in
1827, at the Royal Carriage Department, Woolwich Arsenal. (<a href="#Plate17">Plate 17</a>, fig. 2.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mons Meg.</p>

<p>There is a large gun at Edinburgh Castle, called Mons Meg; it measures about
13 feet 4 inches in length, the diameter of the bore is about 1 foot 6 inches; it has a
chamber about 4 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. (<a href="#Plate17">Plate 17</a>, fig. 3.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Field-guns,
1554.</p>

<p>The battle of Remi, in 1554, was the first action in which light field guns, having
limbers, were used,&mdash;these guns accompanied the cavalry.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Red-hot shot,
1580.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span></p>

<p>Pere Daniel says that red-hot iron shot were used by Marshal Matignan, during
the siege of la F&egrave;re, in 1580.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Calibre, time
of Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In a table of ordnance, given by Fosbrooke, as being a list of the guns used in
the time of Elizabeth, and immediately preceding her, we find how little the calibres
of iron guns have altered during the last two or three centuries, as these guns have all
their antitypes among those of the present day.</p>

<p>The beginning of the seventeenth century was an important epoch in the history
of artillery; and much attention was given to this branch of the military profession,
by Henry IV., of France, Maurice, of Nassau, and Gustavus Adolphus of
Sweden. <span class="sidenote">Origin of
canister and
grape.</span>The former of these distinguished leaders, introduced new and improved
forms and kinds of missiles; such as tin cases, filled with steel bolts or darts; canvas
cartridges, containing small balls, and hollow shot or shells, filled with combustible
materials. <span class="sidenote">Improved
mode of loading,
by Gustavus
Adolphus.</span>Gustavus Adolphus, introduced really serviceable field guns, of a lighter
construction than had hitherto been made use of, and he also adopted the use of
cartridges, with shot attached, so that these pieces might be discharged eight times
before the musket could be fired six. It is said that he chiefly owed his victory at
Leipzig, in 1631, to guns made of leather and coiled rope, over a cylinder of copper
or gun metal. On the whole, the artillery of Gustavus was admirably organized; and
he was the first who appreciated the importance of causing artillery to act in concentrated
masses, a principle, now so fully recognized by all artillerists.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bombs at sea.</p>

<p>Bombs were first used at sea, by the French, in the bombardment of Algiers,
Oct. 28th, 1681, in the reign of Louis XIV.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The largest
gun.</p>

<p>One of the largest cannon now existing is a brass one at Bejapoor, called
&#8220;Moolik-i-Meidan,&#8221; or &#8220;The Lord of the Plain.&#8221; It was cast in commemoration of
the capture of that place by the Emperor Alum Geer, in 1685. Its length is 14ft.
1in., diameter about 5ft. 8in., diameter of bore, 2ft. 4in., interior length of bore,
10ft.; length of chamber unknown; shape of gun nearly &#8220;cylindrical;&#8221; description
of shot, <i>stone</i>. An iron shot for this gun, of proper size, would weigh 1600lbs. It
is now lying in a dilapidated circular bastion on the left of the principal gateway of
the city. The trunnions are broken off, and there is a ring on each side of it, as well
as two Persian inscriptions on the top. It is placed on three heavy beams of wood,
packed round with large stones. A number of <i>stone</i> shot, of 2ft. 2in. in diameter, are
scattered about. This gun is said to be the heaviest piece of ordnance in the world.
It weighs about forty-two tons. An Italian of Otranto, who served in the Mogul
armies under the title of Renni Khan, had it in his park of artillery, and used it at
several battles, occasionally firing sacks of copper coins out of it. (<a href="#Plate18">Plate 18</a>, fig. 2.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gun at Moorshedabad.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable gun near the palace of the Nawab of Moorshedabad,
which measures 17ft. 8in. in length, 5ft. in circumference at the smallest part near
the muzzle, while it is only 6in. in the diameter of the bore, and the foresight is at
least four or five inches above the muzzle. After the battle of Khallissie, which was
fought about 25 miles from here, it is supposed to have been buried under a tree.
The tree, having grown since then, has forced the gun above the ground about three
feet, where it now remains, partly encircled by the roots and trunk. It has no name;<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
the natives call it &#8220;the gun in the tree.&#8221; It is made of cast iron, and is evidently of
Indian manufacture, having Hindostanee inscriptions engraved on it, but no date.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Size and expense
of cannon,
1688.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilkins says, &#8220;These Gunpowder instruments are extremely expensive,
as a whole cannon commonly weighs 8000lbs., requiring 90 men, or 16 horses, with
a charge of 40lbs. of powder, and a ball weighing 64lbs&#8221;.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Length and
weight
gradually
reduced.</p>

<p>The length and diameter of cannon became gradually much reduced, experience
having determined how much they might be diminished in weight without injury to
their safety, or to the effects they were intended to produce.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Horse
artillery by
Frederick the
Great.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great of Prussia made some improvements with regard to the
calibre of field guns, and to him may be given the credit of the introduction of Horse
Artillery.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Guns bored.</p>

<p>Guns, at this period, were cast hollow by means of a core, which was kept
suspended in the centre of the mould, while the metal was being run in. Owing,
however, to the great difficulty experienced in keeping this core in a perfectly true
position, several artillerists deliberated whether guns, cast hollow or solid, had the
preference, and investigations took place as to the possibility of boring the latter, the
result of which was, that Maritz, who had a foundry at Geneva, informed the Court
of France, in 1739, that he had discovered a method of boring guns and mortars
which had been cast solid. He was at once invited to France, where, first at Lyons,
and afterwards at Strasbourg, he secretly worked at boring pieces of ordnance, which,
on trial, proved perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Guns of ice.</p>

<p>In the year 1740, a curious experiment in artillery was made at St. Petersburgh,
where guns were cut out of solid ice, from which balls of the same substance were
fired repeatedly, without bursting.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Improvements.</p>

<p>From this period, the science of artillery progressed rapidly, and various improvements
were made in this arm of the service, <span class="sidenote">Axle-trees.</span>such as the introduction of iron
axle-trees, <span class="sidenote">High limbers.</span>and high
limbers for the carriages of field guns. <span class="sidenote">Reduction of
windage.</span>The reduction of windage,
(mainly owing to the invention of carronades), and the use of cartridges and
elevating screws, which latter served to render the fire of artillery much more rapid
and regular.</p>

<p>The invention of rifled ordnance is claimed by a Dr. Lind and a Capt. A. Blair,
late 69th regt. <span class="sidenote">Rifled ordnance
1774.</span>Experiments were made at Landguard Fort, 26th August, 1774, by
which it was intended to prove that shot weighing 42lbs., in the shape of a pear,
would do as much execution, fired out of an 18 pounder, with a third of the quantity
of powder, as could be effected by round balls of the same weight, fired from a 42
pounder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Perforated
and fluted
shot.</p>

<p>Sundry trials were also made with shot perforated through the centre, and
spirally fluted on the surface, suggested by Professor Anderson, of Glasgow, in order
to prevent the common aberration in the flight of shot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Leaden projectiles.</p>

<p>There were different modes of charging the rifled guns; one was, after the
powder was put in, to take a leaden bullet something larger than the bore of the gun,
and grease it well; in ramming it down with an iron rammer hollow at one end, the
spiral threads of the rifle entered and cut into the bullet, and caused it to turn round<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
in going down, and on being shot out, it would rotate on an axis coincident with its
flight. <span class="sidenote">Breech-loading
Rifled
cannon.</span>Another mode was to charge them at the breech, where an opening for the
reception of the powder and ball was afterwards closed up by a screw; but some
barrels were screwed off at the breech-end to be charged, where they were made
stronger than common.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Congreve&#8217;s
rockets.</p>

<p>The adaptation of the rocket to the purposes of war, by Sir William Congreve,
in 1806, introduced a new feature into the artillery of this and other countries.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mr. Monk&#8217;s
improvements.</p>

<p>Recently, at the suggestion of a Mr. Monk, of Woolwich Arsenal, a quantity of
useless metal has been removed from before the trunnions, and the thickness increased
considerably at the breech end, where alone it was wanted.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mallet&#8217;s
monster
mortar.</p>

<p>The monster mortars recently constructed by Mr. Mallet, of separate compound
hoops, must be regarded as a triumph of constructive skill. The shell is 30 inches in
diameter, holding a bursting charge of 480 lbs., and weighing when charged 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tons
(3,360 lbs.). Value of shell charged, &pound;25. Weight, without bed, 42 tons. Weight
of bed, 8 tons. Total, 50 tons.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cavalli&#8217;s and
Wahrendorff&#8217;s</p>

<p>In 1846, two rifled cannon were invented, one by Major Cavalli, of the Sardinian
Artillery; and the other by Baron Wahrendorff, a Swedish nobleman. Both
of these were iron breech-loading guns, having two grooves in order to give the requisite
rifle motion to their projectiles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Experiments
to test.</p>

<p>Experiments were carried on at Shoeburyness, in 1850, with these guns. The
deviations were always in the direction of the rotation of the projectiles; but they
were so variable in amount that no allowance could be made for them in laying the
gun with respect to the object. The Cavalli gun became unserviceable after having
fired four rounds, by the copper ring or bouche imbedded in the metal of the gun at
the bottom of the bore being damaged. The Wahrendorff gun stood well, the wedge
resisting more effectually the force of the discharge than that of the Cavalli gun.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lancaster&#8217;s
rifle gun.</p>

<p>Mr. Lancaster&#8217;s novel invention of applying the rifle principle to cannon, may be
described as &#8220;a two-grooved rifle in disguise,&#8221; having a &#8220;gaining twist,&#8221; the bore
being an ellipse.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Defects of.</p>

<p>The chief defect in the Lancaster gun is the liability of the projectile to jam in
the bore, both in loading and firing, the former rendering the loading difficult, while
the latter endangers the safety of the gun. In consequence of several of these guns
bursting, and also from the anticipated large range with great precision not being
obtained from them, the Lancaster guns were removed from the service after the
Crimean war.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sir W. Armstrong.</p>

<p>Sir W. Armstrong submitted a proposal for his breech-loading gun to the Duke
of Newcastle, then Minister at War, towards the end of 1854; his proposal being
accepted, and a gun accordingly constructed, it was submitted to numerous trials,
both at Shoeburyness, and near Sir W. Armstrong&#8217;s private factory at Newcastle.
This gun is now made entirely of wrought iron, although the original one had a steel
bore. It is a built-up gun, that is to say, it is composed of separate pieces, each
piece being of such moderate size as to admit of being forged without risk of flaw or
failure. By this mode of construction, great strength, and consequently, great lightness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
are secured. The shell used combines the principle of the shrapnel and percussion
shell, i.e., it may be made to explode either as it approaches the object, or as it
strikes it. Moreover, it may be made to explode at the instant of leaving the gun,
in which case, the pieces spread out like a fan, and produce the usual effect of grape
or canister. Armstrong&#8217;s guns are now (1860) being employed in China.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Whitworth.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s rifled gun, with which experiments were lately made near
Liverpool, is also a breech-loading piece, and of the following construction. The
form of the bore is that of a hexagonal spiral, the corners of which are rounded off.
The inclination of the spiral varies with the diameter of the bore, but is in all these
guns very great, the projectiles being comparatively long.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French rifled
ordnance.</p>

<p>Rifled ordnance were introduced into the French service just previous to the
commencement of the late Italian war of 1859, and aiming at the greatest practical
simplicity, the French government adopted only one nature of gun for field service,
and one for siege purposes, both made of bronze. The French rifled cannon are
muzzle loading, and those first introduced had two or three grooves, but the field
pieces used in Italy had six grooves, their inclination being about one turn in 59
inches. A number of heavy cast-iron guns are rifled with two grooves, and have
been placed on board French ships of war; and these, unless strengthened, could be
used but with very small charges.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages of
rifled guns.</p>

<p>The advantages obtained by the successful employment of rifled <span class="nowrap">guns&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="advantages">

<li>Great accuracy of fire,</li>

<li>Small charge,</li>

<li>Simplicity of equipment and ammunition,</li>

<li>Lightness of gun.</li>

</ul>

<p class="sidenote">Classification
of artillery.</p>

<p>Artillery may be classed under the several heads of field artillery (including
artillery of position), siege artillery and artillery for the armament of garrisons,
fortresses, and coast defences; its equipment is a combination of men, materiel, and
horses necessary for these services.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Three kinds
of guns.</p>

<p>All ordnance employed in the service, may be divided into three classes, viz.,
Guns, Mortars, and Howitzers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Carronades
discontinued.</p>

<p>Carronades may be considered obsolete, although a certain number are still
supplied to the navy, and a few will be found mounted in some garrisons and coast
batteries.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Classification
of guns and
their uses.</p>

<p>Guns are used for projecting shot and shell, horizontally or at very low angles,
and as they are fired with large charges of powder, which are fixed for each nature of
gun, very great strength and considerable weight are required in their construction.
Guns are of two kinds, viz., (solid) shot guns, and shell guns. Some guns are also
classed as heavy, medium, and light. Those generally employed for field service, are
made of bronze or gun-metal; all guns of higher calibre, of cast-iron.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mortars.</p>

<p>Mortars are short pieces of ordnance, used to throw shells at high angles (vertical
fire), generally 45&deg;, the charge varying with the range required; they are distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
by the diameters of their bores. Mortars are made of cast-iron or bronze; the former
being principally intended for garrisons, battering trains, the navy, &amp;c., and the latter,
which are of small calibre, and very light, are chiefly employed in sieges.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Howitzers.</p>

<p>Howitzers resemble guns in form, but are much shorter and lighter in proportion
to their calibre, and are, consequently, fired with less charges of powder; shells and
case are fired from them, but not solid shot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Use of
Howitzers.</p>

<p>These pieces were originally introduced for the purpose of firing shells at low
angles, and have constantly been found most useful both in the field and in siege
operations during the wars of the last and present centuries. <span class="sidenote">Superseded
by shell guns.</span>Since, however, the
introduction of shell guns their utility has greatly decreased, for the shell gun possesses
greater accuracy and range than the howitzer, those being in the present day of
greater importance than small weight.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Artillery from
the East.</p>

<p>The Germans claim the invention of cannon for their countryman, Bartholdus
Schwartz, who is said to have discovered it in 1336, but seeing that fire-arms first
became prevalent in Europe in those countries which mixed with the Saracens, we
are constrained to lean to the opinion that fire-arms were not re-invented in Europe,
but introduced from the East.</p>

<p>This part of our subject might be much enlarged, but we have merely attempted
to give heads of information, which can be pursued by those who desire to do so.
We must now leave it, in order to treat upon that more immediately interesting to
officers of infantry, viz., the history of portable fire-arms.</p>

<p>The earliest hand-guns differed in nothing but in size from the small cannon of
the day: they consisted of a metal tube fixed in a straight stock of wood; the vent
was at the top of the barrel; there was no lock of any kind. The barrels were short
and made of iron or brass; they were occasionally furnished with moveable chambers.
(<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 1.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">With trunnions.</p>

<p>A specimen of hand-cannon of the early part of the reign of Henry VI., is made
of iron, and furnished with trunnions, which from this specimen, appear to have been
appropriated to small fire-arms before they were adopted for artillery. <span class="sidenote">Breech-loader.</span>The breech is
made of a separate piece and screwed on to the tube, on the further end of which is a
sight. It was placed on a stock or club, and fired by hand with a match.
(<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 2.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Invented
14th century.</p>

<p>That hand-guns were invented, though but rarely appearing, in the fourteenth
century, seems very probable from several cotemporary evidences. An inquisition
taken in 1375, at Huntercombe, (a place belonging to the Abbey of Dorchester) and
now preserved among the records at the Chapterhouse, Westminster, states that one
Nicholas Huntercombe, with others, to the number of forty men, armed with &#8220;haubergeons,
plates, bacenettes, cum aventayles, paletes, lanceis, scutis, arcubus, sagittis,
balistis, <i>et gonnes</i>, venerunt ad Manerium de Huntercombe, and there made assault,&#8221;
&amp;c. It appears very improbable that a body of men making a sudden attack upon an
abbey manor-house, would be armed with any kind of &#8220;gonnes&#8221; except hand-guns.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bohemia 1340.</p>

<p>Mons. Mangeot states that &#8220;canons de fusil&#8221; were said to have been first invented
in Bohemia, 1340, but that it is safer to fix the date at 1378, when mention is made
of the &#8220;arquebuse &agrave; m&egrave;che&#8221; in Germany. In the year 1381, the inhabitants of
Augsburg had thirty six arquebusiers, and in the following year they had portable
fire-arms at the battle of Rosabecque. <span class="sidenote">Lithuanians
1383.</span>In 1383 the Lithuanians were acquainted with
hand fire-arms, and used them at the siege of Froski. All these arms had straight
stocks.</p>

<p>In the excavations of the Castle of Tannenberg, dismantled in 1399, there was
found a hand-gun of brass, with part of the wooden stock remaining, and the iron
rammer belonging to it.</p>

<p>An early mention of the hand-gun is that of Juvenal des Ursins, who tells us,
under the year 1414, that they were used at the siege of Arras.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Siege of Lucca
1430.</p>

<p>Billius, a learned and noble Milanese, who lived at the time, says that hand-guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
were first used at the siege of Lucca, in 1430. The Florentines were provided with
artillery, which, by the force of gunpowder, discharged large stones, but the Luccquese
perceiving that they did very little execution, came at last to despise them, and every
day renewed their sallies to the great slaughter of their enemies, by the help of <i>small
fire-arms</i>, to which the Florentines were strangers, and which before this time were
not known in Italy. Billius explains this by saying, <span class="sidenote">Said to have
been invented
in Italy.</span>&#8220;That besides darts and balistas
for arrows, they invented a new kind of weapon. They carried in their hand a club,
a cubit and a half long, to which were affixed iron barrels. These they filled with
sulphur and nitre, and by the power of fire, iron balls were thus ejected.&#8221;
(<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 1 and 10).</p>

<p class="sidenote">Scorpion.</p>

<p>About this time the scorpion (afterwards a piece of ordnance) was a tube for
firing gunpowder, held in the hand, and called by the English, hand-cannon, and also
hand-culverines.</p>

<p>From a roll of purchases for Holy Island 1446 is,&mdash;&#8220;bought 11 hand gunnes de
ere,&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Made of brass.</span>from whence we learn that they were made of brass.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Edward IV.</p>

<p>Hand-guns, or hand-cannons were used in the early part of the reign of
Edward IV., and towards the close of it, we learn from Philip de Comines, <span class="sidenote">Harquebus
invented.</span>that the
harquebus was invented; this seems to have been an improvement on the hand-gun.
The Latin word used for this weapon was arcusbusus, evidently derived from the
Italian, arca-bouza, a bow with a tube or hole; to that people, therefore, <span class="sidenote">Stock, &amp;c.,
from cross-bow.</span>are we to
ascribe the application of the stock and trigger in imitation of the cross-bow. <span class="sidenote">Match-lock.
1478.</span>Hitherto
the match had been applied by the hand to the touch-hole, but the trigger of the
arbalest suggested the idea of one to catch into a cock, which having a slit in it, might
hold the match, and by the motion of the trigger be brought down on a pan which
held the priming, the touch-hole being no longer at the top but at the side.
(<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 9).</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hand-gun improvements.</p>

<p>The hand-gun was <i>cast</i> in brass, and, as a tube, was of greater length than the
hand cannon; a flat piece of brass, made to turn upon a pin, covered the pan which
contained the powder; <span class="sidenote">Sighted.</span>it had also a piece of brass fixed on the breech, and
perforated to ensure the aim.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hand-guns in
England 1471.</p>

<p>The first introduction of hand-guns into England, we find, was soon after their
invention in Italy; in the year 1471, King Edward IV., landed at Ravenspurg, in
Yorkshire, and brought with him, among other forces, three hundred Flemings, armed
with &#8220;hange-gunnes.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Made in England,
1474.</span>In 1474, he directed &#8220;all the bombs, cannon, culverines,
fowlers, surpentines, and all other cannon whatsoever, as also powder, sulphur, saltpetre,
stones, iron, lead and other materials, fit and necessary for the same cannon,
wherever found, to be taken and provided for his use, paying a reasonable price for
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Harquebusiers.</p>

<p>Arquebusiers, or harquebusiers, are mentioned as troops, by Philip de Comines,
in these words, <span class="sidenote">Morat 1476.</span>where he speaks of the battle of Morat, fought on the 22nd of June,
1476. &#8220;The said towns had in their army, as some that were in the battle informed
me, 35,000 men, whereof fower thousand were horsemen, the rest footmen, well
chosen and well armed, that is to say, 10,000 pikes, 10,000 halberds, and 10,000
harquebusiers.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span></p>

<p>Hitherto the harquebuss had only a straight stock, but now it had a wide butt
end, <span class="sidenote">Held to breast.</span>which might be placed against the right breast, and thus held more steadily.
Many ancient pieces were held to the breast instead of the shoulder, which will
account for their being so short in the stock. A notch was made in the butt for the
thumb of the right hand, in order to hold the piece more firmly. <span class="sidenote">Bent butt.</span>When the butt was
bent down or hooked as it was at a later period, it was called, from the German word
Hake, <span class="sidenote">Hackbutt.</span>a hackbutt, haggebut or hagbut, the small sort being denominated demi-hags.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mounted Harquebussiers.</p>

<p>Philip de Commines mentions that there were at the battle of Fourni&eacute;e, in 1495,
German harquebusiers, on foot and on horseback. (<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 6.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arms in time
of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The small arms in the time of Henry VIII., were hand-guns, haguebuts, demi-hagues
and the pistol, and it was enacted, &#8220;that no hand-gun should be used, of less
than one yard, gun and stock included, and the haguebut was not to be under three-quarters
of a yard.&#8221; The demi-hagues were still smaller, and gave occasion for the
origin of pistols, which were invented in the latter part of this reign, at Pistoria in
Tuscany. The dag, dagger, or tache, differed from the pistol merely in the shape of
its handle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Inconveniences
of match.</p>

<p>The match was a constant source of trouble to the soldier, both from the
difficulty of keeping it alight in bad weather, and from the length of time it sometimes
took to ignite the charge. <span class="sidenote">Objections to
fire-arms.</span>It was therefore not without justice that many persons
clamoured about this time against the introduction of fire-arms. They contended that
upon no point, save that of penetration, was the harquebuss superior or equal to the
long-bow; <span class="sidenote">Rest.</span>its great weight 16 or 18lbs. (seldom less than 12lbs.) obliged it to be
supported by a rest, which had a kind of fork to receive the musket, and at the bottom
a sharp metal spike, to strike into the ground; (<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 5, 7, and 8). When
the harquebuss was shouldered the rest was carried in the right hand, and subsequently
hung upon it, by means of a string or loop. The difficulty of keeping the powder and
match dry, the time taken to load, and its comparative inaccuracy, rendered it of low
reputation. Nevertheless it held its ground, <span class="sidenote">Wheel-lock,
1517.</span>and the next improvement was the
wheel-lock, by which a more instantaneous ignition of the charge was secured; it was
invented at Nuremberg, 1517. It consisted of a little solid wheel of steel, fixed
against the plate of the lock of the harquebuss or pistol; it had an axis that pierced it
in its centre; at the interior end of this axis which went into the lock, a chain was
fastened, which twisted round it on the wheel being turned, and bent the spring by
which it was held; to bend this spring a key was made use of, into which the exterior
end of the axis was inserted. By turning this key from left to right, the wheel was
made to revolve, and by this movement a little slider of copper, which covered the
pan with the priming, retired from over it; and by the same movement the cock,
armed with a flint like the cock of a fusil, was in a state to be discharged on pulling
the trigger with the finger; the cock then falling on the wheel, produced fire, and
communicated it to the priming. <span class="sidenote">Used at Parma,
1521.</span>The wheel-lock was first used at the siege of Parma,
1521, <span class="sidenote">In England,
1530.</span>and was brought to England 1530. It was however complicated and difficult
to repair, for which reason it could not always be depended upon, as is proved by
some fire-arms of this description at the Tower, <span class="sidenote">Serpentine
and wheel.</span>which are made with a serpentine, as
well as with a wheel, both acted upon by the same trigger.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Musket in
Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span></p>

<p>The inconsiderable execution done by pieces of small calibre probably caused
the introduction of the muskets or mosquet, which originated in Spain about the time
of Francis I. <span class="sidenote">At Pavia,
1525.</span>They are said to have been first employed extensively at the battle of
Pavia, 1525; but, if we believe Brantome, it was the Duke d&#8217;Alva who first brought
them into use in the armies, when during the reign of Philip II., <span class="sidenote">Low Countries,
1567.</span>he went to take upon
him the government of the Low Countries in the year 1567; but that only means, he
brought them more into fashion than they were till that time, and that till then they
were rarely used, at least in the field, on account of their cumbrous nature. A
Spanish army of 10,000 men sailed from Carthagena, 27th April, 1567, <i>en route</i> for
the Netherlands, to do which they had to cross the Alps. It was a picked body of
troops, of whom about 1,300 were cavalry. The Duke d&#8217;Alva formed them into three
divisions, and dispensed with artillery, not wishing to embarrass his movements.
Each company of foot was flanked by a body of soldiers, carrying heavy muskets
with rests attached to them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lephanto,
1571.</p>

<p>At the battle of Lephanto 1571, fought between the Venetians and Turks, it is
stated by the historian, that one chief reason why so few Christians were killed in
comparison, was because the Turks used for the most part bows and arrows, whereas
the former were supplied with muskets.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Caliver.</p>

<p>A lighter kind of musket was called a caliver or calliver, which was only a
corruption of calibre, denoting that they were all of one guage, as the original
harquebuses were not of any particular length or bore; the caliver was fired without
a rest.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dimensions,
1621.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Kellie in his &#8220;Art Militaire,&#8221; published in 1621, says, &#8220;The barrel
of a musket should be four feet in length, the bore capable of receiving bullets twelve
whereof weigh a pound, previous to this some had carried ten to the pound.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hand-mortar,
1594.</p>

<p>The hand-mortar for throwing grenades are said to have been first used in 1594,
and gave origin at a later date to the troops thence denominated, <i>grenadiers</i>. They
appear to have been fired from the shoulder. (<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 3.) In the reign of
James II., <span class="sidenote">From butt of
musket.</span>a flint-lock-musket was adapted to fire grenades from the butt, the small of
which was made to resemble a chambered mortar; the heel of the butt formed a
cover, which opened with a spring on a hinge; the priming was put into the usual
pan, and a small piece of metal moved so as to open a communication with the powder
in the chamber. A rest was formed by a slender iron rod, about three feet long, and
when not required let into the stock, in the place usually occupied by the ramrod,
and turning upon a pivot placed a few inches in front of the guard-brass. The
scouring rod is run through metal loops on one side of the stock. <span class="sidenote">By hand.</span>Afterwards
grenades were thrown by hand, the musket being slung over the soldier&#8217;s back, and
more recently experiments were made with an iron tube about four inches long, <span class="sidenote">From muzzle.</span>placed
on the muzzle in the same manner as the bayonets.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Match-locks
and rest,
James I.</p>

<p>In the time of James I., part of the infantry were armed with calivers or muskets
and rests, both of which were fired with match-locks, the soldier carrying the match
lighted at both ends.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Trickerlock,
1629.</p>

<p>&#8220;A match trickerlock compleat,&#8221; occurs in a schedule of 1629. This was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
adoption of what is now called a hair trigger, which was added to the former one, and
gives a more instantaneous discharge. A tricker wheel lock of Charles I., a tricker
match-lock of Charles II., and a tricker fire-lock of James II., are preserved in Sir S.
Meyrick&#8217;s collection.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Fowling
pieces.</p>

<p>The Earl of Albermarle in 1646, says, &#8220;It is very fit likewise that you have in
each company six good fowling pieces, of such a length that the soldier may well be
able to take aim and shoot off at ease; being placed six on each flank of a division of
foot to skirmish with an enemy. These soldiers ought to have command, when they
come within distance, that they shoot at officers only.&#8221; We have here plainly the
origin of riflemen.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tin tube for
match.</p>

<p>Each musketeer formerly carried a tin tube, pierced full of holes, to contain the
match, and prevent his being discovered; in wet weather it was necessary to carry it
in the crown of his cap, to prevent it from being extinguished. <span class="sidenote">First fire-lock.</span>One of the earliest
attempts to overcome this difficulty is in the Arsenal, at Dresden, where there is an
old <i>buchse</i>, with a piece of pyrites fixed opposite to the touch-hole, and which requires
to be rubbed with a file, chained to it, until sparks are elicited sufficient to fire
the powder.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Snaphaunce.</p>

<p>The next improvement upon the wheel-lock was the snaphaunce; a flat piece of
steel, furrowed in imitation of the wheel, was placed on a steel post, which being
screwed beyond the pan, was made moveable; the pan had a cover which required to
be pushed off by the thumb, and the furrowed piece being then brought to stand over
it, on pulling the trigger, the flint, which was substituted for pyrites, struck against it,
and gave the spark.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Flint lock.</p>

<p>The next step in the improvement of the musket was the introduction of the
flint-lock, now so well known, that I need not enter into the details of its
mechanism.</p>

<p class="sidenote">In France,
1630.</p>

<p>It was used in France as early as 1630, but was not employed in the army until
1670 or 80, when it took the name of &#8220;fusil.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">In England,
1677.</span>It was not employed in England
until about 1677, and its advantages over the matchlock are thus described in a work
addressed to King Charles II., in 1677, <span class="sidenote">Earl Orrery&#8217;s
opinion.</span>by the Earl of Orrery:&mdash;&#8220;First it is
exceedingly more ready, for with the fire-lock you have only to cock, and you are
prepared to shoot, but with the matchlock, you have several motions, besides if you
fire not the matchlock as soon as you have blown your match, (which often,
particularly in hedgefights and sieges, you cannot do) you must a second time blow
your match. The match is very dangerous, either when bandoliers are used, or
when soldiers run hastily in fight to the budge barrel, to refill their bandoliers. I
have often seen sad instances thereof. Marching in the nights to avoid an enemy
or to surprise one, or to assault a fortress, the matches often discover you, whereby
you suffer much, and he obtains much. In wet weather, the rain deads the powder
and the match too, and the wind sometimes blows away the powder, ere the match
can touch the pan; nay, in very high winds, I have seen the sparks blown from the
match, fire the musket ere the soldier meant it, and either thereby lose his shot,
or kill some one before him. Whereas in the firelock, the motion is so sudden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
that what makes the cock fall on the hammer, strikes the fire and opens the pan at
once. Lastly, the quantity of match does much add to the baggage, it naturally
draws the moisture of the air, which makes it less fit, and if you march without
close waggons, it is the more exposed, and without being dried again in ovens is but
of half the use which otherwise it would be of, and which is full as bad as the skeans
you give the corporals, and the sinks you give the private soldiers, being rendered
useless if damp; nothing of all which can be said of the flint, but much of it to the
contrary.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bows to be
replaced by
muskets, 1596.</p>

<p>In a proclamation of Queen Elizabeth dated 1596, it is stated, &#8220;You shall bring
with you all such furniture and weapon for footmen as you stand charged withall by
statute, or have formerly shewed at other musters heretofore, changinge your billes
into pikes, and your bowes into muskettes accordinge to our sayde former letters.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Muskets with
two locks.</p>

<p>In France, as late as 1702, when the flint had wholly superseded the pyrites, and
the structure differed very little from our present musket-locks, an additional cock was
attached to the end of the lock-plate, and a sliding cover placed over a hole in the
hammer-seat, for the purpose of lighting the powder by a match, if the flint failed.
<span class="sidenote">Match-lock
preferred.</span>The match was therefore from its simplicity, preferred from all others for a considerable
period, and is still used by the Chinese, Tartars, Persians, and Turks, in some
provinces either wholly, or partially. <span class="sidenote">Match made
of.</span>The match itself was made of cotton or hemp,
spun slack, and boiled in a strong solution of saltpetre, or in the lees of wine.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Iron ramrod
1740.</p>

<p>In the time of Frederick the Great, (1740 to 1786), the invention of the iron
ramrod by the Prince of Dessau, trifling matter as it seems, doubled the value of the
fire of infantry. Prior to this the rammer had been made of wood, and was called
the scouring stick.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dimensions,
&amp;c. of English
musket, in
1800.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this (19th) century, the weight of the English musket
and bayonet was, 11lbs. 4ozs., bayonet 1lb. 2ozs., length of barrel 3ft. 3-in., bore
&middot;753-in., bullets 14<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to the pound.
<span class="sidenote">Charge.</span>Charges of powder 6 drs., F.G. Every soldier
was furnished with three flints for 60 rounds. <span class="sidenote">Priming, 1st.
mode.</span>Originally it had been necessary to put
the priming into the pan from a flask, containing a finer grained powder, called
&#8220;Serpentine powder,&#8221; but in the early flint-lock musket this was rendered unnecessary,
as in loading, a portion of the charge passed through the communication
hole into the pan, where it was prevented from escaping by the hammer. <span class="sidenote">Priming, 2nd
mode.</span>Latterly a
portion of the cartridge was bitten off, and the pan filled with priming before
loading.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Objections to
flint-lock.</p>

<p>The objections to the flint-lock were, that it did not entirely preserve the priming
from wet. Sometimes the flint failed to ignite the charge, and it was necessary to
change it frequently. Owing to these imperfections, in 1807, the Rev. Mr. Forsyth
obtained a patent for priming with fulminating powder. The composition consisted
of sulphate of potash, sulphur, and charcoal, <span class="sidenote">Priming by
detonation,
1807.</span>and exploded when struck by any metal
or hard substance. This composition was considered too corrosive, but was subsequently
improved, and finally applied to the musket, in the form of the present
percussion cap, which consists of chlorate of potash, three parts; fulminating mercury
two parts; and ground glass one part. <span class="sidenote">Experiments,
1834.</span>The experiments for Mr. Forsyth&#8217;s invention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
commenced in 1834. Six thousand rounds were fired from each description of arm,
and the experiments conducted in all weathers, six of each kind of arm being used.
<span class="sidenote">Advantages
of percussion.</span>The result proved exceedingly favourable to the percussion principle, and may be briefly
summed up as follows:&mdash;1st, out of 6,000 rounds from the flint-lock, there were 922
missfires, being 1 in 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, whereas in the percussion musket there were only 36 misses
in 6,000 rounds, or 1 in 166. With the flint-lock there were 3,680 hits out of the
6,000, and with the percussion 4,047 hits, being 7 per cent. in favour of the latter.
To fire 100 rounds with the flint required 32 minutes 31 seconds, whereas the
percussion occupied only 30 minutes 24 seconds. Another advantage of the percussion
musket, was that it was capped <i>after</i> being loaded. Hitherto a certain amount of
powder had been allowed for priming, but as this vestige of the hand-gun could be
dispensed with, <span class="sidenote">Reduced
charge.</span>a reduction of charge could be made; a total reduction however was
made from 6 to 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drs., which caused a diminution of recoil. The 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drs. then
recommended was known to be more than was necessary for the projection of the
bullet, but an extra <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> dr. was retained to allow for the effect of damp or waste on
service. In the course of these experiments, <span class="sidenote">Reduced pull
of trigger.</span>it was found that the considerable force
required to pull the trigger might be advantageously reduced, and that increased
accuracy would ensue, therefore the pull of the trigger was lessened to 7lbs.</p>

<p class="sidenote">New model
musket.</p>

<p>The advantages of the percussion system having been satisfactorily shown, it was
decided to convert a portion of the old flint-locks into percussions, and to establish a
new model percussion musket for the English army.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Percussion at
Canton.</p>

<p>The following anecdote illustrates the weak points of the flint-lock. During the
Chinese war, a company of the 37th Madras Native Infantry had been detached to
the left, when, the evening closing, the order was given to rejoin, and the whole were
to retire upon Canton, and just as it was being carried into execution, a tremendous
storm of wind and rain arose, making the air so dark, that no one could see 20 yards.
The detached company retired sounding bugles and beating drums, which were
drowned by the tempest, and they could not find the battalion. In a few minutes
the enemy got between this company and the retreating force. The muskets would
not go off, and several attempts of the enemy to close were with difficulty repulsed
with the bayonet. In the meantime, the enemy contrived to fire off their own
matchlocks, and some of the sepoys&#8217; muskets of men who had dropped in the retreat,
by applying matches to them. The square into which the company was formed, was
thus being diminished, while the only return that could be made, was an occasional
shot from a solitary musket, which the three officers of the company managed to
clean out, under cover of great coats held over the muzzle. A company of Marines
was dispatched for the 37th party, armed with percussion muskets, scarcely one of
which missed at the first fire, and a few volleys sufficed to clear the way, and both
detachments reached the camp in safety, with but little loss. This happened in the
early part of 1841.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Percussion
introduced,
1842.</p>

<p>After a &#8220;hang-fire&#8221; of about 200 years, a new pattern percussion musket was issued
in 1842. Its weight was greater than that of the old flint-lock, being with the bayonet about
11-lbs., 6-oz., bayonet 1-lb., 0-oz., 8-drs., bore &middot;753, barrel 3-ft.
3-in., length, with bayonet<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
6 feet, length without 4-ft. 6<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in., <span class="sidenote">Sighted for
150 yards.</span>a block sight for 150 yards, and a percussion lock.
For many years prior to 1839 no sight at all was thought necessary for the musket,
the bayonet stud being sufficient, but which was totally obscured when fired with
fixed bayonets. This arm continued as the approved weapon for our infantry without
improvement until 1851, when the Mini&eacute; rifle was partially introduced.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Comparison
with foreign
muskets.</p>

<p>The English musket (1842) differed from all those in use on the Continent, in
having, 1st, the least accuracy, 2nd, reduced range, 3rd, heavier, 4th, shorter, 5th,
larger bore, 6th, greater windage, 7th, double the charge of powder, 8th, the greatest
recoil, and 9th, the most expensive! <i>i. e.</i>, as compared with those of France and Belgium,
Prussia, Austria, or even with the old Sikh matchlock!! And yet a &#8220;stand
up fight&#8221; was stoutly maintained for this most inefficient arm, by many military men,
as may be seen from the following extract from a note in Part II., Vol. II., of the &#8220;Aide
Memoire to the military sciences:&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<span class="sidenote">Brown Bess
advocated.</span>Erroneous ideas prevail as to the precise wants
of the service with regard to the musket, and its proper qualities and utility in the
field, as well as much exaggeration as to the defects of the new percussion musket
of 1842, for the infantry of the line. It is stated that it is too heavy and of imperfect
construction. Some prefer the French pattern, and others would lessen the
weight and calibre still more, reducing also the windage: as, however, the new regulation
has brought into use some hundreds of thousands of new muskets, and has been
approved by the highest authorities, some considerations are necessary before a
radical change can be effected beyond range and a nice accuracy of fire. 1st,
What are the essentials for a musket for the infantry of the line? 2nd, The application
of the musket to the infantry soldier. It is evident that the most essential
points are strength, and facility of pouring into your enemies&#8217; ranks a powerful fire.
Troops do not halt to play at long bowls; a field of battle presents a series of movements
for the purpose of outflanking or closing in upon your enemy, and when
within two hundred yards, to deliver your fire with effect. Firing at 500 or 600
yards is the business of artillery, and, therefore, to fire at 300 or 400 yards is
a misapplication of the musket, a loss of time, a waste of ammunition, and tends to
make men unsteady in the ranks.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Brown Bess
tried at
Chatham.</p>

<p>The shooting powers of the musket (1842) are stated in the report on Experimental
Musketry firing carried on by Captain (now Lieut.-Colonel) McKerlie, Royal
Engineers, at Chatham, in 1846, which concludes as follows: &#8220;It appears by these
experiments, that as a general rule, musketry fire should never be opened beyond
150 yards, and certainly not exceeding 200 yards. At this distance, half the number
of shots missed a target 11-ft. 6-in., and at 150 yards a very large proportion
also missed. At 75 and 100 yards every shot struck the target, only 2-ft. wide, and
had the deviation increased simply as the distance every shot ought to have struck
the target 6-ft. wide at 200 yards, instead of this, however, some were observed to
pass several yards to the right and left, some to fall 30 yards short, and others to
pass as much beyond, and this deviation increased in a still greater degree as the
range increased. It is only then under peculiar circumstances, such as when it may
be desirable to bring a fire on Field Artillery when there are no other means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
replying to it, that it ought ever to be thought of using the musket at such distances
as 400 yards.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Merits of
&#8220;Brown Bess&#8221;
illustrated.</span>In fact, it has been stated that the probability of hitting one man
with a musket ball at 500 yards would be as one farthing to the National Debt! On
a recent occasion, at the Cape, 80,000 rounds were fired to kill 25 men!! To put a
man &#8220;<i>hors de combat</i>&#8221; requires his weight in lead, and six times his weight in iron!!!</p>

<p class="sidenote">Price.</p>

<p>Our musket cost &pound;3, the French and Belgian &pound;1 8s. 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>d. <span class="sidenote">Fastened by
bands.</span>In foreign arms the
barrel is fastened to the stock by bands, binding the two together, and thus adding
greatly to their strength. This mode, although acknowledged to be infinitely superior
for military purposes, by our Inspector of small arms, <span class="sidenote">Bands
unsightly!!</span>was condemned as unsightly!!
The French musket, although three inches longer, is beautifully poised, being lightened
forward. <span class="sidenote">Supposed
profit of large
bore.</span>Our bore being larger was considered an advantage, as their balls
could be fired out of our barrels, while our balls could not out of their muskets. It
was generally thought that the greater weight of the English ball produced an
increased range and momentum, but this was counteracted by the excess of windage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="sidenote">Various forms
of early fire-arms.</p>

<p>In former days small arms were made of various shapes and devices, and also
combined with other weapons of attack and defence.</p>

<p>There is in the arsenal at Venice a matchlock containing twenty barrels, ten
gun barrels, about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet long, and ten pistol barrels half that length. The match
exploded a gun and pistol barrel together.</p>

<p>The Chinese of the present day make use of a species of matchlock revolvers,
and also of another matchlock, consisting of several barrels, placed on a common
stock, diverging from each other, and fired simultaneously. (<a href="#Plate4">Plate 4</a>, fig. 4 and 5.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Shield fire-arms.</p>

<p>Soon after the invention of fire-arms, the boss, or spike, issuing from the centre
of the targets or shields, was superseded by one or more short barrels, fired by a
matchlock, and having an aperture covered with a grating above, for the purpose of
taking aim. <span class="sidenote">Breech-loaders.</span>These barrels were loaded at the breech, the charge being put into an
iron tube, or short barrel, which was pushed in at the end, and retained there by
shutting down a lid or spring.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cross-bow
and pistol
united.</p>

<p>There were cross-bows, which combined a pistol and cross-bow, the wheel-lock
being placed about the centre of the handle on one side, whilst on the other was the
string of the bow, and the windlass for drawing it up.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Pike and
pistol.</p>

<p>Pistols were frequently introduced into the butt-end of pikes, and also, in the
reign of Edward VI., in the handle of the battle-axe, the spiked club, the martlet,
and other weapons, even the dagger.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Carabines
with joint.</p>

<p>In the time of Charles I. there were esclopette carbines, made with the butt to
double back on a hinge, in order to get them into a holster; <span class="sidenote">Heel plate to
draw out.</span>and a little later the
butt was lengthened by drawing out the steel cap which formed its cover, now called
heel plate.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Revolvers in
Charles I.</p>

<p>In the reign of Charles I. there were also revolvers, with eight chambers to hold
the charges; and in the time of Cromwell and Charles II. we find self-loading and
self-priming guns. <span class="sidenote">Double-barrelled
pistols.</span>Pistols were made both double-barrelled and revolving.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Arrows fired
out of muskets,
1591.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<p>In Sir Richard Hawkins&#8217; account of his voyage in the South Sea, 1591, mention
is made of his shooting arrows from muskets with great success at shipping: &#8220;for the
upper works of their ships being musket proof, they passed through both sides with
facilitie, and wrought extraordinary disasters, which caused admiration to see themselves
wounded with small shot when they thought themselves secure.&#8221; These
wooden arrows were called sprites or sprightes. Lord Verulam says, &#8220;it is certain
that we had in use at one time for sea fight short arrows which they call sprights,
without any other head save wood sharpened, which were discharged out of
muskets, and would pierce through the sides of ships, when a bullet would not
pierce.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sprites required
wads.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Hawkins informs us, that in a discourse which he held with the
Spanish General, Michael Angell, the latter demanded, &#8220;for what purpose served the
little short arrowes which we had in our shippe, and those in great quantity. I
satisfied him that they were for our muskets. Hereof they prooved to profit themselves
after; but for that they wanted the tampkins, which are first to be driven
home, before the arrow be put in, and as they understood not the secret, they rejected
them as uncertaine, and therefore not to be used; but of all the shot used now
adayes, for the annoying of an ennemie in fight by sea, few are of greater moment
for many respects, which I hold not convenient to treat of in public.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it appears that bullets of metal, have been fired out of bows and slings,
stone balls out of guns, and arrows from muskets.</p>

<h2>THE BAYONET.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">Pointed stake.</p>

<p>It was common with archers to place a long pointed stake in the ground to
protect themselves against cavalry. On the arquebus replacing the bow the same
practice was continued.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Pike.</p>

<p>From the earliest ages it had been customary to arm some of the infantry with
pikes, and in the middle ages when cavalry was so much employed in armies, it was
found impossible to dispense with this weapon; for some time after the introduction
of fire-arms, only a portion of the infantry were armed with them, and the remainder
were pikemen. The proportion of each varied at different times, from one half to two
thirds, but as the proportion of musketeers increased it became necessary to contrive
some method, by which they could defend themselves.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the reign of James I., some attempts were made to convert
the musketeer&#8217;s rest into a defence against cavalry. <span class="sidenote"><i>Marlets-de-fer</i>
with touch.</span><i>Marlets-de-fer</i> and small pole-axes
had a touch enclosed in them, which by touching a spring opened a small valve
and sprung out. <span class="sidenote">Rest, with
touch.</span>The musket rest, instead of having a wooden shaft, was now made
of a thin tube of iron, like these pole-axes covered with leather, and armed with the
touch. <span class="sidenote">Swines&#8217;
feathers.</span>Rests thus armed were said to contain Swedish or Swines&#8217; feathers. It was
found however that the musketeer could not do his duty when armed with musket,
sword, and rest, (especially if he had a Swedish feather to manage with them) which
led to the abandonment of the rest during the Protectorate.</p>

<p>To remedy the inconvenience of a Musketeer being compelled to draw his
sword and defend himself after the discharge of his piece, and to render him more
competent to act against the pikemen, a long thin rapier blade fixed into a handle,
and carried in a sheath called a Swine&#8217;s feather, was drawn out of its scabbard, <span class="sidenote">Sword stuck
in muzzle.</span>and
fixed into the muzzle of his gun, which gave him a weapon of great length.
(<a href="#Plate19">Plate 19</a>, fig. 11.). And this dagger or sword, stuck into the muzzle of the gun, gave
origin to the bayonet, <span class="sidenote">Bayonets in
France, 1671.</span>which was first made at Bayonne, and introduced into the
French army in 1671.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Swords discontinued,
1745.</p>

<p>Swords in general were left off in the battalion companies ever since the year
1745, and about 1762 by the grenadiers. <span class="sidenote">Improved
bayonet.</span>As a still further improvement the bayonet
was made to fit on to the side of the barrel, so as to leave it clear. <span class="sidenote">Bayonet in
Flanders,
William III.</span>An early
application of the improved bayonet took place in the campaigns of William III., in
Flanders. Three French regiments thus armed, marched with fixed bayonets, and
one of them against the 25th regiment. Lieut-Colonel Maxwell ordered his men to<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
screw their bayonets into their muzzles to receive them; but to his great surprise
when they came within the proper distance, the French threw in such a heavy fire, as
for the moment to stagger his people, who by no means expected such a greeting, not
conscious how it was possible to fire with fixed bayonets. Macaulay in the 3rd
volume of his History, <span class="sidenote">Bayonet at
Killicrankie.</span>states &#8220;That at the battle of Killicrankie, the King&#8217;s army being
drawn up in position, the Highlanders advanced to the attack, and immediately after
having delivered their fire, threw away their muskets and rushed on to the charge
with Claymores. It took the regular musketeer two or three minutes to alter his
missile weapon into one with which he could encounter an enemy hand to hand,
and during this time the battle of Killicrankie had been decided.&#8221; Mackay therefore
ordered all his bayonets to be so made that they might be screwed upon the
barrel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bayonets,
Marsaglia,
1693, and
Spiers, 1703.</p>

<p>Bayonets were employed by Marshal Catinat at the battle of Marsaglia, when
the slaughter was immense. Also at the battle of Spiers, in 1703. Thus improved,
the bayonet came into general use, <span class="sidenote">Pike
abolished,
1703.</span>and the pike was abolished in France by Royal
Ordinance 1703, with the advice of Marshal Vauban. Before the introduction of the
improved bayonet, Lord Orrery, in 1677, thus speaks in favour of the pike:&mdash;<span class="sidenote">Earl Orrery in
favour of pike
versus musket,
1677.</span>&#8220;But
what need I more say of the usefulness of the pike above the musket, than that all
persons of quality carry the pike which they would not do unless it had adjudgedly
the honour to be the noblest weapon, since the bravest choose and fight with it. I
wish our companies consisted of fewer shots and more pikes, for they are not only
always in readiness but need no ammunition, which cannot be said of the musket
which requires powder, bullet, and match, and in wet or windy weather often disappoints
the service.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">M. Mallet,
pike versus
musket, 1684.</p>

<p>Mons. Mallet in his &#8220;Travaux de Mars,&#8221; speaks lightly of the &#8220;mousquetaires,&#8221;
without pikemen; he says, &#8220;A horse wounded by a fire-arm is only more animated,
but when he finds himself pierced by a pike, all the spurs in the world will not make
him advance.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gen. Loyd,
pike versus
bayonet, 1766.</p>



<p>Even so recently as about ninety-two years ago, and ninety-five years after the
introduction of the improved bayonet, General Loyd in his history of the war in
Germany, recommends the abandonment of the system of arming the whole of the
infantry with fire-arms, &#8220;which he says are useful only in <i>defensive</i> warfare, and even
then not more than one shot in four hundred takes effect.&#8221; For many years after
pikes were discontinued by our infantry, the officers carried a short one, and the
sergeants only gave up their halberts within the last thirty years. The soldiers of
artillery when in Holland under the late Duke of York, <span class="sidenote">Pike recently
discontinued.</span>carried short pikes for the
defence of their field guns.</p>

<h2>ACCOUTREMENTS AND AMMUNITION.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">Armament of
infantry soldier.</p>

<p>Besides his matchlock, the soldier carried a powder horn or flask, a ball bag,
slow match, a rest, and a sword. The two last changed for a bayonet. In order to
accelerate the loading, <span class="sidenote">Bandolier.</span>a
large leather belt, called bandolier, was worn over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
shoulder. To this were hung twelve wooden cases, each of which contained one
charge, with a case of finer powder for priming, and at the lower end a bag for balls.
This system was soon found to be inconvenient, as the cases were apt to get entangled
in passing through woods, &amp;c. <span class="sidenote">Bandolier
abandoned in
France, 1684.</span>It was therefore abandoned in France in 1684, <span class="sidenote">Flask
resumed.</span>and
the flask resumed. Sir James Turner, speaking of the pistol, says, <span class="sidenote">Patrons.</span>&#8220;All horsemen
should always have the charges of their pistols ready in patrons, the powder made
up compactly in paper, and the ball tied to it with a piece of pack thread.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Cartridges.</span>In this
description we have evidently the cartridge, though not expressed by name. It is a
curious fact that these were first confined to the cavalry, and that the general adoption
of the cartridge was not earlier than the common use of the modern firelock.
The Patron was an upright semi-cylindrical box of steel, with a cover moving on a
hinge, filled with a block of wood with five perforations, to hold as many pistol
cartridges.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Earl of Orrery
in favour
of pouches.</p>

<p>The Earl of Orrery, in 1677, writes, &#8220;I am, on long experience, an enemy to
bandoliers, but a great approver of boxes of cartridges for them, as by biting off
the bottom of the cartridge, you charge your musket for service with one ramming.
I would have these boxes of tin, because they are not so apt to break as the
wooden ones are, and do not, in wet weather, or lying in the tents, relax. Besides,
I have often seen much prejudice in the use of bandoliers, which are often apt to
take fire. They commonly wound, and often kill he that wears them, and those
near him, for likely if one take fire, all the rest do in that collar. They often
tangle when they have fired, and are falling off by the flanks of the files of the
intervals to get into the rear to load again. Their rattling in the night often
discovers the designs; and if the weather be windy, their rattling also often hinders
the soldier from hearing, and, consequently, obeying the word of command.
Whereas the cartridge boxes exempt those who use them from all these dangers
and prejudices. They enable the soldier to fire more expeditiously. They are also
usually worn about the waist of the soldier, the skirts of whose doublet and whose
coat doubly defend them from all rain, that does not pierce both, and being worn
close to his body, the heat thereof keeps the powder dryer. Besides all this, whoever
loads his musket with cartridges, is sure the bullet will not drop out, though
he takes his aim under breast high; whereas those soldiers on service who take the
bullets out of their mouths, which is the nimblest way, or out of their pouches,
seldom put any paper, tow, or grass, to ram the bullet in, whereby if they fire
above breast high the bullet passes over the head of the enemy, and if they aim low
the bullet drops out, ere the musket is fired, and it is to this that I attribute the
little execution I have seen musketeers do in time of fight, though they fired at
great battalions, and those also reasonably near.&#8221;</p>

<h2>HISTORY OF THE RIFLE.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">Invention of
the rifle.</p>

<p>We shall now direct our attention to the rifle,&mdash;its invention is ascribed to Gaspard
Zollner, of Vienna, towards the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1466.</p>

<p>The first society for firing with the arquebuss was founded at B&acirc;le, in Switzerland.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles at Leipsic,
1498.</p>

<p>In the practice of firing at a mark, at Leipsic, 1498, the greater part of the Sharpshooters
or Marksmen, were armed with the Rifles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles used
first for
amusement.</p>

<p>At first, Rifle arms were used only for amusement, and sometimes for the defence
of places, but very rarely as weapons of war in the field.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles used in
war.</p>

<p>Their employment in a campaign only dates from a little before the middle of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Landgrave of
Hesse, 1631.</p>

<p>In 1631, the Landgrave William of Hesse had three companies of Chasseurs,
armed with rifles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elector Maximilian,
1645.</p>

<p>In 1645, the Elector Maximilian of Bavaria formed three regiments of Chasseurs,
armed with rifles which he intended to employ principally in the minor operations
of war.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Frederick
William of
Prussia, 1674.</p>

<p>In 1647, Frederick William of Prussia, in his campaign on the Rhine, distributed
in each company of infantry, some light infantry and Riflemen.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Frederick the
Great in
Seven Years&#8217;
War.</p>

<span class="sidenote">By Austrians
ditto.</span>

<p>Frederick the Great, in order to counterbalance the Austrian Light Troops, more
particularly the Tyrolese Marksmen, whose fire was exceedingly deadly, felt obliged
during the seven years&#8217; war to add a company of trained light infantry to the effective
strength of each battalion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in
France, 1674.</p>

<p>In France the Cavalry were supplied with rifles before the Infantry. Towards
1674 Louis XIV. created some squadrons of Cavalry armed with &#8220;Carabines ray&eacute;es.&#8221;
The name was given in France to all arms which were grooved, and it also served for
the name of the corps which were first armed with them, viz., &#8220;Carabins.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in English
Life
Guards.</p>

<p>In 1680 eight rifle carbines were carried in each troop of English Life Guards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in
Sweden, 1691.</p>

<p>In 1691 the Non-Commissioned Officers of the Swedish Dragoons received the rifled
carabin, and in 1700 those of the Prussian Cavalry received the same rifled arms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Experiments
in England,
1776.</p>

<p>Experiments were tried with rifled small arms in England in the year 1776.</p>

<p>We read in the Scots&#8217; Magazine, vol. 36, that &#8220;the Guards are every day practising
the use of the Rifle Gun in Hyde Park. On Saturday, April 27th, 1776,
their Majesties attended a Review of the Rifle-men yesterday, and were much
pleased with the dexterity of the officer, who loaded and fired several times in a
minute, and hit the mark each time. He lies upon his back when he discharges
his piece.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in Austria,
1778.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>Austria kept 2000 Sharpshooters, having double carbines, which were supplied
with a crotch to rest them upon while shooting. Only one of the barrels was rifled.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in
French infantry,
1793.</p>

<p>In 1793 the first model carbine for French Infantry was made at Versailles; at
the same time the model for Cavalry was also fixed. Rifles were soon abandoned in
the French Army; they deemed them of more trouble than profit.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles, English,
1794.</p>

<p>In 1794 the English adopted the Rifle, which, I fancy, was first used by a
Battalion of the 60th, or Royal American Regiment.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles numerous
in Austria,
1796.</p>

<p>In 1796 there were in the Austrian Army 15 Battalions of Light Infantry, the
greater part of whom were armed with Rifles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles for the
95th regt.,
1800.</p>

<p>In 1800, Rifles were placed in the hands of the 95th Regiment, now the Rifle
Brigade of four Battalions. These Rifles weighed about 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>lbs. each, with the sword.
They were sighted for 100 and 200 yards, with seven grooves, having a quarter turn
in the length of the barrel, which was about 2 feet 6 inches, the length of the Rifle
3 feet 10 inches, weight of sword 1lb., diameter of bore &middot;623. The locks were
excellent, and had a detent, to prevent the nose of the sear catching at half cock,
and it had a bolt, to prevent its going off at half cock. The ball was spherical, and
driven in with a mallet, which was afterwards dispensed with, and a greased
patch substituted.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifle ball in
two sizes.</p>

<p>During the Peninsular War, our Riflemen were supplied with balls of two sizes,
the easiest fitting being designed for use where celerity of loading was required.
Baker, who made these Rifles, says in his Work, 1825, <span class="sidenote">Range of English
rifle.</span>&#8220;I have found 200 yards the
greatest range I could fire to any certainty. At 300 yards I have fired very well at
times, when the wind has been calm. At 400 yards, and at 500 yards, I have
frequently fired, and have sometimes struck the object, though I have found it to
vary much.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles in 7th
and 10th
Dragoons.</p>

<p>Colonel Dickson, R.A., says, &#8220;In the early part of the present century, there was
also introduced a rifle-arm for cavalry. The barrel 20 inches, calibre 20 bore,
grooves 7, having the same pitch as those for the infantry; the 7th and 10th light
cavalry were the only regiments armed with them, but they were soon discontinued
from being considered as unfit for cavalry service.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Brunswick
rifle.</p>

<p>The Brunswick rifle was introduced in 1836. Weight with bayonet 11lbs. 5oz.,
length of barrel 2ft. 6-in., bore &middot;704. Two deep spiral grooves with one turn in the
length of the barrel. Sighted for 100, 200, and 300 yards. Bullet spherical and
belted, diameter &middot;696. Weight of bullet 557 grains. The shooting of this arm was
superior to our first rifle, although the loading was not so easy as was desired, and a
great disadvantage existed in the bullet and cartridge being separate in the soldier&#8217;s
pouch, the grooves were deeper and rounder than those of the ordinary rifle, the
projecting zone of the ball was made to fit the grooves, the ball was wrapped in a
linen patch dipped in grease. It was found that, although the rifle loaded easily at
first, after constant firing the barrel became very foul, rendering loading nearly as
difficult as under the old system of the indented ball. The belt on the ball caused
considerable friction while passing through the air. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 1).</p>

<p class="sidenote">Merits of the
Brunswick
rifle.</p>

<p>By a committee of officers assembled at Enfield, it was determined that all firing<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
with the Brunswick beyond 400 yards was too wild to give a correct angle of elevation.
It was tested at Antwerp in 1844, in an experiment extending to 44,000 rounds, and
declared to be the worst tried.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Improvements
from
France.</p>

<p>From France chiefly have proceeded most of the modern improvements in
fire-arms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French at discount
without
rifles.</p>

<p>The original French rifle (like our own) was loaded by force with a strong
ramrod and mallet, and they found that it gave precision with diminution of range.
For these reasons during the early campaigns of the French Revolution, the rifle was
given up in the French army; but as their Chasseurs were found to be unequally
matched against those of other armies, who surpassed them in accuracy as marksmen,
a series of experiments were carried on at different times, with a view to its reintroduction
into their service. No satisfactory result was obtained until the occupation
of Algeria, <span class="sidenote">Captain Delvigne&#8217;s
first
step to restore
rifles in
France.</span>when Mons. Delvigne, of the Guarde Royale, took the first step in its
restoration. In the flying wars kept up against them by Abd-el-Kader, they found
that masses of their men were struck by Arab balls at distances where the French
muskets were apparently powerless, and this they afterwards found arose from the
long matchlocks of their enemies being fired at a much greater elevation than was
ever thought of by European troops. <span class="sidenote">The French
desired to be
on an equality
with Arabs.</span>In order to put themselves on an equality with
their enemies, Mons. Delvigne showed in 1828 how the rifle bullet could be made to
enter the piece easily, and quit it in a forced state; a method of loading as easy and
simple as that of a smooth-bore arm. <span class="sidenote">Expansion by
chamber.</span>Expansion was obtained by the introduction of
a chamber in the bore, which furnished an annular surface to receive the bullet, and
on its being struck a small blow with the rammer it was expanded into the grooves.
(<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 2). <span class="sidenote">Defects of
chambered
rifle.</span>The objection to the chambered rifle, was that after frequently
firing, a residuum collected which eventually left the powder less room in the chamber,
and of necessity it then reached above the shoulder of the latter, so that the ball
resting upon the powder instead of upon the shoulder of the chamber, was not so
readily dilated by the strokes of the ramrod into the grooves. To remedy this defect
the wooden sabot and greased patch (<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 3) were suggested by Colonel
Poncharra, in 1833, <span class="sidenote">Poncharra
Delvigne rifle
1833.</span>introduced into the French army 1839, and employed in Algeria,
1840, but several inconveniences attended its use.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Carabine &agrave;
Tige, 1842.</p>

<p>Colonel Thouvenin endeavoured to overcome these difficulties by fixing at the
bottom of the bore an iron shank, around which was placed the powder. This stem,
(<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 4) stopping the bullet, allowed it to be struck in such a manner as to
cause the lead to penetrate into the grooves. <span class="sidenote">Defects of
Tige.</span>There is much fouling at the breech,
and around the pillar of these rifles. They are difficult to clean, the soldier having to
carry an instrument for this purpose. <span class="sidenote">Tige introduced,
1846.</span>The Chasseurs and Zouaves of the African
Army were armed with the tige in 1846.</p>

<p>At first a spherical ball had been used, and then a solid cylindro-conical bullet
was resorted to; (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 6.) Messrs. Delvigne and Mini&eacute; having long previously
experimented with hollow cylindro-conical projectiles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mini&eacute; iron
cup.</p>

<p>Some years after these experiments, Captain Mini&eacute; proposed the adoption of a
bullet which should receive its expansion by placing an iron cup in the hollow of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
base, which should be driven up by the gas, and force the walls of the cavity outwards,
thus making them enter the grooves. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 7.) <span class="sidenote">French army
1850.</span>In 1850 the Fusil
ray&eacute; with balle &agrave; culot was put into the hands of some French regiments of the line,
and since then the French Imperial Guard have been armed with the old musket
rifled, and a hollow bullet without a cup.</p>

<p>At present it is understood that the French are rifling all their smooth bore
arms, and the Russians are doing the same.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Prussian.
army.</p>

<p>The Prussians have many thousands of their infantry armed with a breech-loading
long range Rifle. <span class="sidenote">Russian
riflemen.</span>The Russian Army is to have fifty-four rifle regiments, with a
rifle company to each other regiment of Infantry. <span class="sidenote">Austrian
riflemen.</span>The Austrians are busy at work,
according to their means. The Tyrol has always supplied them with a large number
of marksmen. <span class="sidenote">Belgium.</span>The Belgians are, I believe, universally armed with rifles,
<span class="sidenote">Portugal.</span>and even
the little Kingdom of Portugal has ordered 28,000 rifles from Belgium.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Conoidal
bullet, with
Brunswick.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the French experiments with the conoidal bullet, and the great
results obtained over the spherical from it, it was proposed to adapt a conoidal bullet
to the Brunswick Rifle. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig 5.) This was done as an experiment, and
succeeded very well, but at the same time the new arm, <span class="sidenote">Mini&eacute; rifle,
introduced,
1851.</span>called the Mini&eacute; pattern,
1851, was also tried, and the shooting exhibited greater accuracy with this latter arm.
Nothing further was done with the Brunswick rifle and conoidal bullet; and the
(then called) &#8220;new regulation Mini&eacute;,&#8221; was introduced into the service by the late
Marquis of Anglesea, Master-General of Ordnance, with the approval of the late Duke
of Wellington. Its weight with bayonet, was 10lbs. 8<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>ozs., bore &middot;702, four
spiral grooves, with one turn in 6 feet 6-in., powder, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drs., bullet, 680 grs., with iron
cup, diameter of bullet, &middot;690, windage, &middot;012. <span class="sidenote">Performance
and angle of
Mini&eacute;.</span>When the axis is parallel to the ground
at 4 feet 6-in. above it, the first graze is about 177 yards, and the angle of elevation
at 800 yards, is 3&deg; 25.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Consequences
of improvements
in military
rifles.</p>

<p>A few years previous to the Russian war, rifles had attained to a degree of improvement
in structure and adaptability to the general purpose of war, which
threatened subversion to the established notions of the military world.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Probable
effect on
artillery.</p>

<p>The artillery arm was menaced in its long rested monopoly of range and precision,
with an equilibrium in hands it had never dreamed to find it; one which not alone
would curb the wonted dash of field batteries to within the &#8220;shortest range,&#8221; <span class="sidenote">On cavalry.</span>but
also impress a more than wonted respect upon the best led and most daring cavalry,
for even the thinnest formation of that arm, which it had hitherto been taught to
despise. <span class="sidenote">Mini&eacute; in
Kaffir war.</span>The Mini&eacute; was first used in the Kaffir war, and next at Alma and Inkerman,
when it proved that the gallant Marquis had advanced a step in the right direction;
who had ordered 28,000, but quarrels taking place among the contractors this order
was never completed. <span class="sidenote">Bullet improved.</span>The accuracy of firing from the Mini&eacute; was improved by
altering the form of the bullet from conoidal to cylindro-conoidal, (<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 8.)
and the iron cup from hemispherical to a conical shape with a hole in the apex.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lord Hardinge&#8217;s
desire
for improvement.</p>

<p>Lord Hardinge, succeeding to the post of Master-General, and after to that of
Commander-in-Chief, zealously followed out the prosecution of the now becoming
fixed idea, the general adoption for British infantry, of a pattern rifle-musket, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
should combine lightness with solidity, precision, and superior range. Lord Hardinge
opened competition to the leading British gun makers, when the following sent in
muskets for trial, viz:&mdash;Purdy, Westley Richards, Lancaster, Wilkinson, and Greener.
<span class="sidenote">Experiments
at Enfield.</span>The Mini&eacute; pattern, (51), and Brunswick, (36), were also subjected to a course of trial
before the committee assembled at Enfield, in 1852, for the purpose of determining the
best description of fire-arm for military service.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Merits of the
Brunswick.</p>

<p>The Brunswick rifle showed itself to be very much inferior in point of range to
every arm hitherto tried. The loading was so difficult, that it is wonderful how the
rifle regiments can have continued to use it so long, the force required to ram down the
ball was so great as to render a man&#8217;s hand much too unsteady for accurate shooting.
Colonel Gordon, says, &#8220;It should be noticed here with the exception of Mr.
Wilkinson, every one of the makers changed either his musket or projectile during
the trials, thereby causing them to be protracted much beyond the time originally
intended.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">All had reduced
bores.</p>

<p>The diameter of the bore of all the new muskets was less than that hitherto in
use, <span class="sidenote">Elongated
bullets.</span>all the bullets were elongated and had auxiliaries for expansion, being metallic, or
in one case a horn plug, one pattern had cannelures <span class="sidenote">Reversed
cartridge.</span>and the whole required the
cartridge to be reversed in loading. <span class="sidenote">Best shooting
from short
rifle.</span>It is worthy of remark that the best shooting at
these trials was from a short rifle made at Enfield, which was named the artillery
carbine, but not the one now used by the Royal Artillery. The barrel was only 2 feet
6-in. long, and the projectile cylindro-conoidal, with an iron cup weighing 620 grains;
thus proving that great length of barrel is not absolutely necessary in a rifle; but a
certain length of barrel is required to fire in double ranks, and so that the weapon may
be effectually used as a pike. <span class="sidenote">Advantage of
small bore.</span>With a small bore, a greater number of rounds of ammunition
may be carried, greater penetration, velocity, lower trajectory, and more
accuracy, than with larger projectiles of equal weight. <span class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of small
bore.</span>The alleged disadvantages of
small bore are, the slender form of cartridge and the smaller hole made in a man&#8217;s
body, as stated to be proved in the case of wild animals, in proof of which it is said
that they are found to run further when wounded with a small ball, than they do with
a large one; but this reasoning does not seem applicable to the human race, for it is
presumed that few men would be found willing to move far when wounded by a
musket ball, whether the hole in their body was &middot;702 or &middot;530 of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Objection to
reversing the
cartridge.</p>

<p>An absurd objection was stated as to reversing the cartridge, viz:&mdash;that drill with
blank would be performed in a different manner to firing ball, and that in action the
soldier would forget to reverse his cartridge, and put in the ball first. As we now
always perform our drill, and as our present blank cartridges require to be reversed or
will not ignite, this objection is removed. It also was said that mice, rats, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
would eat off the lubricating mixture!!</p>

<p>It was proposed to give the Enfield, (1853,) a back sight to 900 yards, when an
outcry was raised against the monstrous proposition of giving to every common soldier
a delicately made back sight, whether he knew how to use it or not!!! and those
rifles first issued, were only sighted to 300 yards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The Enfield
rifle.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the trials at Enfield, in August, 1852, two rifles were made<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
at the Royal Manufactory, in which were embodied the improvements and alterations
suggested by the experience obtained during the course of the trials, and which was
hoped would possess the necessary requirements for a military weapon, and which
proved superior to the Mini&eacute;, the Brunswick, and all those presented for trial by the
different manufacturers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dimensions,
&amp;c., of Enfield.</p>

<p>This beautiful rifle though 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>lbs. less than the old musket, is fully as strong, and
as capable of rough usage. Weight, including bayonet, 9lbs. 3 ozs., bore, &middot;577, length
of barrel, 3 feet 3-in., weight of barrel, 4lbs. 6 ozs., three grooves with spiral of one
turn in 6 feet 6-in.; the barrel to be fastened to the stock by bands. The bayonet to
be fixed by means of a locking ring. The lock to have a swivel. The bullet was
of a pattern suggested by Mr. Pritchett. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 9.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attempts to
improve the
bullet.</p>

<p>Lord Hardinge, desirous to improve the projectile, and if possible to get rid of
the cup, having requested the leading gun makers to lay any suggestions before the
small arms committee, none were submitted but one by Mr. Wilkinson, which was
not a compound. It was solid with two deep cannelures, but it lost its accuracy when
made up into a cartridge, and made very wild practice beyond 300 yards. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>,
fig. 10.) Subsequently a bullet was proposed by Mr. Pritchett, <span class="sidenote">Description of
Pritchett.</span>being cylindro-conoidal
in form, with a small hollow at the base, which was made more to throw the
centre of gravity forward than to obtain expansion thereby. This bullet weighed
520 grains, or 24 guage, and excellent practice was made with it at Enfield, from 100,
to 800 yards, and it was accordingly introduced into the service, to the suppression of
the Mini&eacute;, with iron cup; and for which Mr. Pritchett, received &pound;1,000.</p>

<p class="sidenote" id="Ref01">Lancaster
smooth <i>bore</i>
rifles.</p>

<p>Shortly after the establishment of the School of Musketry, in June, 1853, twenty
Enfield rifles were sent down for trial in competition with the Mini&eacute;, and also with
&#8220;Lancaster&#8217;s smooth bore eliptical rifle, with increasing spiral and freed at the breech,&#8221;
when the Enfield was found to be superior to both. It is stated that Mr. Lancaster&#8217;s
invention is intended to overcome the inconvenience attendant on the wearing out the
rifle ridges, by the ramrod, &amp;c.; these rifles are also easily cleaned, the difference in
width between the major and minor axis of the ellipse was, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of an inch.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Engineer
Carbine.</p>

<p>Carbines on this principle are now carried by the Royal Engineers, and shoot
well, and by some persons are thought to be superior to the Enfield, 1853; they fire
the same ammunition, and there is no question but that their firing is much more
accurate from using the improved wooden plug bullet.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Failure of the
Pritchett.</p>

<p>In May, 1855, the ammunition was found to be in a most unsatisfactory state
and unfit to be used, there being bullets of various diameters in many of the packages
of the cartridges. The correct size of the Pritchett bullet viz., &middot;568, was found to
produce accurate shooting, at 600 yards, while bullets of a smaller diameter fired
very badly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Return to
iron cup.</p>

<p>To get out of this difficulty, Colonel Hay recommended the application of the
iron cup to the bullet, which was approved, when more uniform expansion resulted
and greater accuracy.</p>

<p>Thus by using an auxiliary to expansion there is a margin left to cover any trifling
inaccuracy in manufacture, in diameter of either bullet or bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Woolwich
account for
bad <i>ammunition</i>.</p>

<p>The Woolwich authorities stated that they had seven dies at work making bullets,
and which were made small at first as they gradually wore larger; when any one die
became too large it was destroyed, and replaced by a smaller one. To this cause they
imputed the failure of our Pritchett ammunition. It was afterwards suggested from
the School of Musketry, to procure expansion by using a wooden plug, and after most
extensive experiments, this was found to be superior to any description of bullet yet
tried at Hythe, and the wooden plug has accordingly been established for the British
army. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 11.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">On expansion.</p>

<p>Uniform accuracy mainly results from the bullet continuing to receive a sufficient
and uniform expansion into the grooves, so that the projectiles get such an amount of
rotation as shall last until they have reached the object fired at. The more perfect
the expansion, the less the accumulation of fouling and consequently accuracy is
further increased.</p>

<p>The Enfield has frequently been fired to 200 rounds and the loading continued
easy.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Progressive
grooving 1858.</p>

<p>Early in 1858, the regulation rifle, (53), was changed from grooves of uniform,
&middot;014 in depth, to &middot;005 at muzzle, increasing in depth to &middot;015 at the breech; while
new, these rifles shoot well, but they require increased elevation at long ranges. How
far these shallow grooves will answer, or how long it will take to convert these aims
into smooth bores at the muzzle, by the continued friction of the ramrod, remains
to be seen.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Origin of
progressive
grooving.</p>

<p>Captain Panot, of the French service, states, &#8220;it is but a few years since all our
smooth bore barrels were reamed so that they would carry the spherical ball of &middot;669,
instead of &middot;641. It was afterwards determined to convert these arms into rifles. To
prevent weakening the reamed up barrels, M. Tamisier proposed to vary the depth
of the grooves, making them deeper at the breech than at the muzzle.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Advantages.</span>Grooves
thus made, are said to have a greater accuracy of fire from keeping the ball perfectly
tight as it leaves the bore and destroying all windage at the muzzle. This is called
&#8220;progressive grooving.&#8221; Rifles upon this principle require to be fired at an increased
elevation, attributed to the greater amount of friction experienced by the bullet while
passing down the barrel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Short Enfield.</p>

<p>Rifle regiments and all serjeants of infantry have been furnished with a weapon
requiring the same ammunition as the regulation arm, but six inches shorter, being
mounted in steel, with a sword bayonet.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Royal Navy
rifle.</p>

<p>A five &#8220;grooved progressive&#8221; carbine has recently been given to the Royal
Marine Artillery and the Royal Navy, with the same bore as the Enfield.</p>

<h3>RIFLED BREECH-LOADERS.</h3>

<p>It is worthy of notice that, while numerous attempts are now making to perfect
the breech-loader for sporting as well as military purposes, <span class="sidenote">Early guns
loaded at the
breech.</span>our early cannon and first
hand guns were loaded at the breech, and if all mechanical difficulties could be overcome,
the breech-loading principle for portable fire-arms would deserve the preference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
We can easily understand why it did not continue in favour in early days, as this mode
includes a great deal of perfection in mechanical workmanship, and to which the ancient
gun maker was a stranger.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of breech-loaders.</p>

<p>The great argument against breech-loaders as military weapons is the expense,
their intricate construction, the escape of gas, and the probable waste of ammunition,
in the hands of an uneducated soldier. It may be briefly answered.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1st. As to
expense.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;As to expense, the most destructive weapon, by preventing and curtailing
war, must in the long run be the cheapest.</p>

<p class="sidenote">2nd. As to
intricacy.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;As to intricacy of construction, the soldier is the user, not the maker of his
gun; it matters not how delicate the mechanism of a watch may be, the only question
is, does it continue to go well!! And who dare say that the brains of man shall
never suggest a simple mode of construction. Of course anything fragile would be
totally unfit for military purposes. The escape of gas has been entirely overcome.</p>

<p class="sidenote">3rd. As to
waste of ammunition.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;As to waste of ammunition, is it absolutely necessary that a soldier should
remain uneducated? Are not soldiers men? And men can be taught almost anything,
or are they incapable of being taught? Does a soldier fire how, when and
where he chooses? Is it too high an aspiration that the British army should carry
the best arm that can be made, to be placed in the hands of a taught and skilful
soldier, acting under the guidance and control of intelligent officers?</p>

<p class="sidenote">Breech-loaders
highly
improved.</p>

<p>As far as the arm only is concerned, breech-loaders have now (1860) attained a
high degree of perfection, as is proved by the deserved celebrity of that made by
Mr. Westley Richards. <span class="sidenote">Ammunition
the difficulty.</span>The only remaining difficulty is one of ammunition. Loose
powder cannot be employed in loading with a breech as it can with a muzzle-loader.
We are up to this time under the necessity of introducing the whole of the cartridge,
this of course augments fouling and lessens accuracy; there is also increased difficulty
in producing ignition through the fold of the cartridge paper.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Capt. Brown&#8217;s
compressed
powder.</p>

<p>Recently a most ingenious mode of compressing the grains of powder contained
in a charge into one mass, so that every description of rifle may be rapidly loaded
without any paper, has been invented by Captain Brown, R. N., and I have every
hope and confidence that the only remaining breech-loading difficulty may now be
considered overcome.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages
of breech-loaders.<br />
1st. Celerity.<br />
2nd. Load
lying down.<br />
3rd. Easily
cleaned.<br />
4th. Solid ball.</p>

<p>The advantages of breech-loaders, are, 1st.&mdash;Celerity of fire, about ten rounds a
minute have been attained. 2nd.&mdash;The soldier can load while lying flat on the ground.
3rd.&mdash;The barrel can be easily cleaned and examined as to its state. 4th.&mdash;A solid
ball can be fired, and with less windage.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Self capping.</p>

<p>Various modes of self capping have been brought forward, but that by Maynard
seems to merit the preference; time is further economized, and the powers of the
breech-loader thereby increased.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cavalry have
breech-loaders.</p>

<p>Our cavalry regiments in India, are partially armed with breech-loading rifles,
and all their pistols are rifled, and upon the tige principle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifles universal
in English
army.</p>

<p>The whole of our Guards, regular Infantry, Royal Marines, Militia, and Royal
Engineers, are armed with rifles, and the Carabine used by the Royal Artillery, is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
rifled. All our Colonial corps are supplied with rifled arms, with the exception of the
Native corps, serving in the East Indies and Ceylon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">In larger
numbers.</p>

<p>Thus rifles are introduced in larger numbers and of better quality in the armies
of England, in proportion to their numbers, than amongst any other nation. <span class="sidenote">Taught to use.</span>While
more care and expense is incurred in qualifying our soldiers efficiently to use them.
<span class="sidenote">Prizes.</span>In illustration of which, it is only needful to call attention to the simple fact that
&pound;20,000 per annum is distributed as a stimulus to the marksmen of the British army,
for which boon all honour to our Royal Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Explosive
shells.</p>

<p>The idea has recently been revived to increase the destructive powers of Infantry,
by furnishing them with shells, with which they may explode ammunition waggons,
artillery limbers, &amp;c., &amp;c., to the distance of 1,000 yards. Captain Norton, Mr. Dyer,
Colonel Jacobs, and Mr. Whitworth, have directed their minds to this most
important subject.</p>

<h2>ON RIFLING.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p>It has been stated that amongst the different gun makers who assembled at
Woolwich, for the carrying on of experiments in 1851, no two agreed upon any one
thing; and in 1860, it may still be averred, with almost equal truth, and that it yet
remains an unsettled question as to the form, width, depth, number or degree of
spirality of the grooves, as also the harmony which should subsist between the grooves,
diameter of bore, the form and weight of projectile, and the quality and quantity of
charge.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Description
of Rifles.</p>

<p>Robins, in 1742, says, &#8220;rifles though well known on the continent, being but
little used in England, it is necessary to give a short description of their make.
The rifle has its cylinder cut with a number of spiral channels, so that it is in reality
a female screw, varying from the fabric of common screws, only in this, that its
threads or rifles are less deflected and approach more to a straight line.&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Advantages
of a rifle.</span>The
advantage of a rifle (with a round bullet), is that the axis of rotation not being in any
accidental position, as in a smooth bore, but coincident with the line of its flight, it
follows that the resistance on the fore part of the bullet is equally distributed round
the centre of gravity, and acts with an equal force on every side of the line of direction,
and also should the resistance be greater on one side of the bullet than the other from
irregularities on its surface, as this part continually shifts its position round the line in
which it is proceeding, the deflections which this irregularity would occasion are
neutralized. With an elongated projectile rifling also prevents it from rotating round
its shorter axis.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifling invented
in Germany.</p>

<p>It is to the artizans of Germany, that the rifle owes its origin, as at the close of
the fifteenth century barrels with straight grooves were used by the citizens of Leipsic,
at target practice, <span class="sidenote">Rifles used
1498.</span>in 1498, and the invention of grooving or rifling fire-arms is generally
supposed to be the result more of accident than theory. In Dean&#8217;s Manual of fire-arms,
it is stated that, &#8220;the idea of grooving arms in the direction of the axis of the
barrel to receive the residium of the powder, and thereby, not only facilitate the
loading, but increase both the bite or forcing of the ball, by impressing upon it the
grooves, and thus maintain it during its passage through the barrel in a direction
more in harmony with the line of fire, was doubtless a conception based upon no
previous theory or practice now to be traced, but was formed in that suggestiveness
which in the individual founds for itself a theory based upon the likelihood of
possible result. <span class="sidenote">Straight
grooves.</span>Upon trial also of the straight grooves a greater precision for<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
short distances would have been observed than with the smooth bore.&#8221; This must
of itself therefore have led to the establishment of a certain grade of theory which it
was endeavoured to amplify by various means, such as increasing the number of
grooves, then of changing the inclination of grooves from the straight line to the spiral.</p>

<p>To deem that the practised crack &#8220;shots and armourers of a time when target
practice was the constant recreation of the citizen, and his pride to excel in, were so
brainless as to conceive no theory, unelaborated though it may have been, and that
all their even now admired efforts in Germany, were the products of mere accident, is
therefore scarcely a rational supposition.&#8221;</p>

grooves, by

<p>It is stated that Koster, of Nuremburg, in 1522, first suggested giving a spiral form
to the grooves, and experience proved that much greater accuracy of shooting was
the result.</p>

<p>Koster, of Nuremburg, who died 1630, by some authorities is said to have discovered
that straight grooves did not fulfil the intentions of their inventor, and to have
been the first who suggested spiral grooves in 1620.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Robins first

grooves.</p>

<p>The important stage next arrived at was the scientific explanation of the true
value of spiral grooves. The honor of this entirely belongs to our countryman,
Benjamin Robins, who in his Principles of Gunnery, gives a complete and satisfactory
explanation of the action of the grooves in determining the flight of the bullet.
<span class="sidenote">Robins structure
of rifles.</span>Robins states that &#8220;the degree of spirality, the number of threads, the depth the
channel are cut down to, are not regulated according to any invariable rule, but
differ according to the country where the work is performed, and the caprice of the
artificer. <span class="sidenote">Modes of
loading.</span>The most usual mode of charging rifles is by forcing the ball with a strong
rammer and mallet. But in some parts of Germany and Switzerland, an improvement
is made by cutting a piece of very thin leather or fustian in a circular shape,
somewhat larger than the bore, which being greased on one side is laid upon the
muzzle with its greasy part downwards, and the bullet being placed upon it, is then
forced down the barrel with it. When this is practised the rifles are generally
shallow, and the bullet ought not to be too large.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early rifles,
breech-loaders.</p>

<p>As both these methods of charging rifles take up a good deal of time; the rifled
barrels which have been made in England, (for I remember not to have seen it in
any foreign piece,) are contrived to be charged at the breech, where the piece is
made larger, and the powder and bullet are put in through an opening in the side
of the barrel, which, when the piece is loaded is fitted up with a screw. And
perhaps somewhat of this kind, though not in the manner now practised, would
be of all others the most perfect method for the construction of these sorts of
barrels.&#8221;</p>

<h3>ON THE NUMBER, FORM &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., OF THE GROOVES.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Number of
grooves.</p>

<p>Almost every description of twist, number, &amp;c., &amp;c., of grooves have been tried,
according to the individual tastes and theories of the manufacturers. It is absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
necessary to have two grooves, as a single one would give a wrong direction. Rifles
have been made with, from two to one hundred and thirty three grooves, and in the
majority of cases, an odd seems to have been preferred to an even number. In Dean&#8217;s
Manual it is stated, <span class="sidenote">Degree of
spirality.</span>that &#8220;in the numerous collections of arms that have at various times
come under our personal notice, some were rifled with straight, but the
majority with grooves in a spiral line, sometimes with a half, sometimes a three
quarter, and seldom more than a whole turn in a length of two, two and a half and
three feet; deviations based upon no principle transmitted to us, but requiring
nevertheless a decided research for principles upon which to establish a theory; we
have also met with every one of those configurations of the spiral and form of groove,
&amp;c., &amp;c., which have been arrogated as modern conceits and discoveries.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Spirality.</p>

<p>Some rifles have sharp muzzle twist decreasing to the breech;&mdash;sharp breech
twist decreasing to the muzzle; an increase of twist in the middle of the barrel decreasing
at both extremities.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Modification
in France.
1740.</p>

<p>In France a modification of the Carabine took place in 1740;&mdash;the grooves were
made to begin at eight inches from the muzzle, the unrifled part being of the same
calibre as the bottom of the grooves, so that the bullet might pass easily; thus also
facilitating the loading of the weapon.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rifled only at
muzzle.</p>

<p>There is an old rifle in the United Service Institution, and also a barrel brought
from Lucknow, (in the Model Room of the School of Musketry,) grooved only for
about one foot from the muzzle, the remainder of the barrels are smooth bored.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Degree of
spirality.</p>

<p>The degree of spirality is found to vary from a whole turn in 1 foot 5-in., to a
whole turn in 11 feet.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Depth of
spiral.</p>

<p>The depth of grooves vary from &middot;005 of an inch, to about &middot;125; and some rifles
have been made with an alternate deep and shallow groove.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of
grooves.</p>

<p>Grooves have been made round, circular, triangular, rectangular, and indefinite,
alternate round and angular, elliptical, polygonal; and some cut deep only on one side.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Proportion of
groove to land.</p>

<p>Some gun makers are of opinion that there should be a greater proportion of
groove or furrow than of land or plain surface, because they say the ball is thus more
firmly held, while others maintain that by diminishing the number of the grooves, the
accuracy and range would be increased, and this has led to the opposite theory, that
perhaps if anything, the plain surface of the bore should predominate over the grooved.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of early
grooves
straight.</p>

<p>The earliest rifles had two straight deep creases opposite to each other, the bullet
being spherical, and furnished with small circular knots of lead, large enough to fill
the creases.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form &amp;c., of
ancient rifles.</p>

<p>The greater number of ancient rifles have a whole turn, with an odd number of
deep and rounded grooves; hence we may infer these were considered the best forms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Objects of
rifling.</p>

<p>As accuracy of direction is the result of a spiral motion round an axis coincident
with the flight of the bullet, communicated to it by the grooves, it is clear that the
depth, number, and form of the grooves should be such as will hold the bullet firmly,
and prevent all tendency to strip.</p>

<p class="sidenote">On the degree
of spirality.</p>

<p>The degree of spirality should be sufficient to retain the projectile point foremost
during the whole of its flight. It was at one time supposed that if the spiral turn was<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
great, and the charge strong, the bullet would not conform, but strip, and that the
same results would occur even with grooves but little curved. Unquestionably this
would prove true if certain limits were to be exceeded. A false conclusion was built
upon this theory, viz., that the greater the spiral turn the less the charge should be;
and that therefore in rifles intended for war, the greatest initial velocity being required
to produce the greatest range, the groove should have as little turn as possible;
for extreme ranges have been obtained with Jacob&#8217;s, Whitworth&#8217;s, and Lancaster&#8217;s
rifles; the first has a full turn in 24in. the second in 20in. <span class="sidenote">Sharp twist
and large
charge not
cause stripping.</span>These rifles perform well
with 90 grains of powder, and both Whitworth&#8217;s and Lancaster&#8217;s might even fire
better were the charge of powder increased to 100 grains, the recoil might be
objectionable while there would be no symptoms of stripping.</p>

<p class="sidenote">On depth of
groove.</p>

<p>Great depth of groove can only be hurtful, owing to the difficulty of closing up
all passage to the gas, which should not be allowed to escape round the bullet, as this
would cause deviation and shorten range. Deep grooves become a receptacle for
fouling, are difficult to clean; and high projections must offer great resistance to the
atmosphere, and particularly to a side wind.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Patches.</p>

<p>When fustian or leather are used as patches, they receive and communicate the
spiral motion to the bullet, without the zone of the projectile being at all indented,
but in this case the spiral must be diminished, otherwise the bullet would not turn
with the grooves. If the patches be made of a thick material, the grooves should be
many, broad, and not too shallow, in order to receive the folds of the patch.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Shallow
grooves best.</p>

<p>From our present amount of experience it seems safe to conclude that the
shallower the grooves are the better, so that they perform their intended functions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Proportion of
groove to land.</p>

<p>It is now generally recommended that the grooves be made broader than the
lands, <i>i.e.</i>, that the rifling surface should predominate over the unrifled part of the
bore. Shallow grooves with rounded edges, have the advantage of not leaving any
angular traces on the surface of the bullet, besides they afford a greater facility for
cleaning.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Circular
grooving.</p>

<p>Circular grooving is composed of segments of circles, leaving no sharp edges on
the bullet, and is no doubt a very good form.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gaining twist.</p>

<p>An American gentleman named Chapman, who has written a very clever book
upon the rifle, is a strong advocate for the &#8220;gaining twist,&#8221; which form prevails
generally in American rifles. He states, &#8220;In a rifled barrel, it is obvious that a bullet
instantaneously started from a state of rest, with a velocity of 5,000ft. a second,
must exert at the moment of starting, a tendency to move along the bore in a
straight line. <span class="sidenote">Cause of
canting.</span>However, meeting with the resistance that the lands employ to keep
it to the twist, it communicates to the rifle itself a certain amount of motion in the
direction of the twist of the creases, and this as the angle of the twist increases,
combined with the size of the calibre, and the weight of the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Remedy for
canting.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the angle of the twist at the breech end can be reduced, the bullet at the
same time leaving the muzzle with sufficient spin to last throughout its flight, it is
certain we shall have less twisting of the rifle in the marksman&#8217;s hands, less friction
of the bullet against the lands, less tendency for the bullet to upset, (or be destroyed,)<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
and consequently, from obtaining a higher velocity, (because enabled to
use a greater quantity of powder,) less time for the action of regular or irregular
currents of air.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Uniform
spiral by
American
Government.</p>

<p>After careful experiments by the American Government, preparatory to the
establishing the model for their Military Rifle, it was decided that the turn for the
grooves should be uniform; and that those with an increasing twist did not give any
superiority of accuracy. The &#8220;gaining twist,&#8221; although adopted by Mr. Lancaster,
is opposed by Mr. Whitworth, and all other Rifle manufacturers, and our increased
experience does not prove it to possess any advantages over uniform spirality. Theory
would indicate that it must occasion increased friction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Decreasing
spiral.</p>

<p>Mr. Greener advocates decreasing spirality. It is to be hoped he is the only
advocate for so seemingly absurd an idea. To give a certain measure of spiral turn at
the breech, to be withdrawn gradually as the bullet reaches the muzzle, is simply
ridiculous, and which, with other conceits previously referred to, it is to be hoped
are no more to be repeated.</p>

<p>By the desire of our first Patron, the late Lord Hardinge, Mr. Whitworth was
induced to turn his mechanical genius to the Soldier&#8217;s Gun, <span class="sidenote">Polygonal
rifling.</span>which resulted in his
adopting the polygonal form of bore. His barrel is hexagonal, and thus, instead of
consisting of non-effective lands, and partly of grooves, consists entirely of effective
rifling surfaces. The angular corners of the hexagon are always rounded. Supposing
a bullet of a cylindrical shape to be fired, when it begins to expand it is driven into
the recesses of the hexagon. It thus adapts itself to the curves of the spiral, and the
inclined sides of the hexagon offering no direct resistance, expansion is easily effected.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Westley
Richards
octagonal.</p>

<p>Mr. Westley Richards has followed Mr. Whitworth, by using a polygonal bore,
having applied his highly meritorious system of breech-loading to a barrel upon the
Whitworth principle, of an octagonal form.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Eliptic rifling.</p>

<p>The cardinal feature of this structure is, that the bore of the barrel is smooth,
and instead of being circular, is cut into the form of an ellipse, i.e., it has a major
and minor axis. Upon being expanded by the force of the powder, the bullet is
forced into the greater axis of the ellipse, which performs the office of the grooves,
rifling the projectile, and imparting to it the spiral or normal movement round its
own axis. <span class="sidenote">By Captain
Berner, 1835.</span>In 1835 a Captain Berner submitted his elliptical bore musket to the
inspection and trial of the Royal Hanoverian Commission, appointed for that purpose,
and which gave results so satisfactory, that it was considered admirably adapted for
the J&auml;ger and Light Infantry Battalions. <span class="sidenote">By Mr.
Lancaster.</span>This principle has been patented by Mr.
Lancaster, and the advantages of this form have been <a href="#Ref01">previously</a> adverted to.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Odd number
of grooves.</p>

<p>It is supposed by some persons that if the number of grooves be even, so that
they will be opposite to one another, the bullet would then require more force
to enlarge it, so as to fill them properly. If the number be unequal, the lands will
be opposite to the grooves, and the lead, in forcing, spreading on all sides, will
encounter a land opposite to each groove, which will in some measure repel it, and
render its introduction into the opposite groove more complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span></p>

<p>This ingenious theory is set at nought by Whitworth, Jacobs, Lancaster, W.
Richards, &amp;c., &amp;c., who all recommended an even number of grooves, while the
Government arms have an odd number.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Drift or cant.</p>

<p>If the grooves twist or turn over from left to right, the balls will be carried to
the right; and if from right to left, they will group to the left; and this result will
be great in proportion to the degree of spirality. The causes of Drift or &#8220;Derivation&#8221;
will be treated of <a href="#Ref02">hereafter</a>. We know from observation that the majority of
balls strike to the right of the mark. The recoil and <i>pulling</i> the trigger throw
back the right shoulder, which tend to increase the &#8220;derivation&#8221; to the right. If the
twist were, then, from <i>right</i> to <i>left</i>, the drift, error from <i>pulling</i>, and from recoil, would
tend to neutralize each other; the twist of the grooves should therefore be from right
to left, instead of the present universal practice of from <i>left</i> to right.</p>

<p class="sidenote">On length of
barrel.</p>

<p>The barrel of a gun may be looked upon as a machine in which force is generated
for the propulsion of the bullet. It is well known that the continued action of a lesser
force, will produce a much greater effect, than a greater amount of power applied
suddenly; hence mild gunpowder is more suitable for rifle shooting than strong, or
that which evolves the whole of its gas instantaneously. Time is necessary for the
entire combustion of a charge of gunpowder, consequently more mild gunpowder can
be fired out of a long, than out of a short barrel, as if fired out of a short barrel, some
of the grains might be ejected unconsumed. All extra length, after the last volume
of gas is evolved, can only be injurious, by causing loss of velocity from friction. A
billiard ball would travel none the further nor straighter, were it to be propelled
through a hollow tube, neither would a barrel to a cross bow aid in killing rooks. <span class="sidenote">Favors
expansion.</span>A
barrel favours expansion of the bullet, which is produced by the force of the generated
gas, opposed by the column of air in the hollow tube and by the motion of the projectile.
<span class="sidenote">Assists
aiming, firing
two deep:
when using
bayonet.</span>Facility in aiming is promoted by the sights being distant from each other.
In a military arm a certain length is necessary in order to fire when two deep in the
ranks, and length is also advantageous, should the rifle be used as a pike.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages
of short rifle.</p>

<p>The short rifle can be held steadier when standing, by a weak man, and during
wind, it is handy when passing through a wood or thicket, and a very short man has
more command of his gun when loading; <span class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of short
rifles.</span>but with the sword bayonet, it is heavier
than the long Enfield and bayonet; while the sword is very inconvenient when
running, firing kneeling, or lying down.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Thickness of
barrel.</p>

<p>Great substance was at one time considered necessary for accurate firing, it being
supposed necessary to prevent vibrations in the barrel; this is true within certain limits,
and the heavier the charge, the heavier the metal ought to be, especially at the breech,
but diminishing the thickness, has been proved in no wise to lessen the accuracy. A
heavy barrel also lessens recoil, but it would be folly to carry more weight than would
neutralize the recoil which could be produced by a greater charge of powder than
could be consumed in a given length of barrel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Size of bore.</p>

<p>The two grand requirements of a soldier&#8217;s gun are, celerity of loading, combined
with accuracy at long ranges; and the distance at which he should have the power of
firing, should be limited by the strength of his eye. The weight of the projectile<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
being fixed (&middot;530 grs.), good shooting at extreme distances can only be obtained by
reducing the diameter of the bore, which, lessening the frontage of the bullet, causes
it to experience less resistance from the air; it therefore retains a higher degree of
velocity than a larger bullet of the same form and weight, and therefore travels further
and faster. Gravity has less time to act upon it, in a given distance, and therefore
it can be fired at a lower angle, or has what we call a lower trajectory, and its
accuracy is increased in direct proportion to the lowness of its flight, all other things
being equal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Best form of
rifling still
undetermined.</p>

<p>While the best form, &amp;c., &amp;c., for rifles is not yet determined, there are many
points upon which the generality of persons seem more agreed, viz., reduction of bore
to about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in. in diameter, fewer grooves, shorter barrel, and with increased spirality;
at least, one may safely say that ideas seem to travel in this direction.</p>

<h3>ON RIFLE PROJECTILES.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Projectiles
used in early
guns.</p>

<p>We have learned that out of early Artillery were fired bolts, darts, bombs, stones
and (more recently) iron shot. From the harquebus and musket: arrows, darts,
quarrels, sprites, iron, and lastly leaden spherical balls. <span class="sidenote">Elliptical iron

<p class="sidenote">Leutman.</p>

<p>Leutman, in his &#8220;History of St. Petersburgh,&#8221; says that &#8220;it is very profitable
to fire elliptical balls out of rifled arms, particularly when they are made to enter
by force.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Robins 1742.</p>

<p>Robins, in 1742, recommended the use of projectiles of an egg like form, (see
<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 12), they were to be fired with the heavy end in front, to keep the
centre of gravity forward.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Beaufoy 1812.</p>

<p>Colonel Beaufoy, in a work called &#8220;Scloppetaria,&#8221; 1812, remarks that several
experiments have been tried with egg-shaped bullets, recommended by Robins. It
was found, however, that these bullets were subject to such occasional random ranges,
as completely baffled the judgment of the shooters to counteract their irregularity.
Their deviations to windward most likely arose from the effect of the wind on the
after part, which, as being the lightest of the two, was driven more to leeward, and
consequently acted as a rudder to throw the foremost end up to the wind.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Turpin 1770.</p>

Fort, &amp;c., &amp;c., in 1774. Dr. Lind, one of the inventors, states that to remedy the
deflection of shot, &#8220;One way is to use bullets that are not round but oblong. But in
our common guns that are not rifled, I know no way to prevent deflection, except
you choose to shoot with a rifled bullet.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mr. Greener

<p>Mr. Greener, in 1836, presented an expanding bullet to the Government for

extending nearly through. A taper plug, with a head like a round-topped button, is
also cast of a composition of lead and zinc. The end of the plug being slightly
inserted in the perforation, the ball is inserted either end foremost. When the explosion
takes place, the plug is driven home into the lead, expanding the outer surface,
and thus either filling up the grooves of the rifle, or destroying the windage of the
musket. The result was favourable beyond calculation. Of about 120 shots by way
of experiment, a man was able to load three times to one of the old musket, and
accuracy of range at 350 yards was as three to one.</p>

<p>Many experiments were made by Mr. Wilkinson in 1837, with balls precisely

in 1851 experiments were tried at Woolwich with a soft elastic cork, fitting the
aperture in the projectile very closely, the compression of which it was conceived
would sufficiently expand the cylindrical part, and make it fit the grooves, &amp;c. In
some instances it succeeded perfectly, but in many the cork was driven through the
lead.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Gen. Jacobs.</p>

<p>Major-General Jacobs for many years carried on a series of experiments with
rifles, and in 1846 submitted a military rifle, with an elongated projectile, for experiments,
to the Government at home, and also to that in India. It did not meet with
approval in England, and the Company cut the matter short by stating, that what
was good enough for the Royal Army was good enough for theirs. There is nothing
peculiar in General Jacob&#8217;s rifle. He recommends an elongated projectile (<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>,
fig. 14) solid at the base, cast with four raised flanges to fit into the grooves. General
Jacobs states, that the desired initial velocity could not be produced with a projectile
made entirely of lead, <span class="sidenote">Form of

destroyed.</span>as a slight increase of charge had the effect of destroying the
form of the projectile. He also states that the limit of the powers of leaden balls
having been attained, it became necessary to find a method of constructing rifle balls,
so that the fore part should be capable of sustaining the pressure of large charges of
fired gunpowder, without change of form, and retain that shape best adapted for
overcoming the resistance of the air, on which all accurate distant practice depends;
and at the same time having the part of the ball next the powder sufficiently soft and<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
yielding to spread out under its pressure, so as to fill the barrel and grooves perfectly
air tight. <span class="sidenote">Zinc point to

the bullet cast of zinc, in a separate mould.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Expansion by
hollow bore.</p>

<p>Captain Delvigne, who had been experimenting since 1828, proposed the
adoption of lengthened bullets, consisting of a cylinder terminated by a cone, which
was subsequently replaced by an ogive. He obtained a patent dated 21st June, 1841,
&#8220;For having hollowed out the base of my cylindro-conical bullet, to obtain its
expansion by the effect of the gases produced through the ignition of the powder.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hollow in
case to throw
centre of
gravity
forward.</p>

<p>The main object of Captain Delvigne in hollowing the base was, to throw the
centre of gravity forward; but a Captain Blois, in France, had previously tried this
important suggestion. Captain Delvigne states, if the hollow is too deep, the
expansion is too great, and the consequent friction enormous; or the gas may pass
through the bullet, and leave a hollow cylinder of lead within the barrel. Sometimes
the gas will traverse the sides of the bullet, and consequently the projectile is
deprived of a proportionate amount of velocity; if too small, the expansion does not
take place.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Capt. Mini&eacute;
iron cup.</p>

<p>Captain Mini&eacute;, an instructor of the School at Vincennes, merely fitted into this
hollow an iron cup, hoping to prevent the gas forcing its way through the bullet, and
that the iron pressing upon the lead should increase the expansion. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig. 7).</p>

<p>A perfect bullet was now supposed to have been discovered, of a cylindro-ogival
form, (no part was a true cylinder), having a groove originally intended to fasten on
a greased patch, and in some cases the cartridge, but the patch being dispensed with,
and the cartridge reversed, <span class="sidenote">Groove
suppressed.</span>the groove, supposed to be useless, was suppressed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Results.</p>

<p>People were then surprised to find that firing lost much of its accuracy, and the
groove was replaced; when it was observed that any variation in its shape and in its
position, materially affected the practice. Not only variations in the grooves caused
great alteration in the accuracy of fire, but any modification bearing on the trunk in
rear, or on the fore-ogive, altered the conditions of the firing, so that the groove
became lost in the midst of so many other principles, the functions of which were so
much unknown. These theoretical considerations served, however, as a point of
departure for further investigations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tamisier
lengthened
bullets.</p>

<p>Captain Tamisier had not ceased for several years, concentrating his attention on
the subject. He varied the length of the cylindrical part and the angle of the cone,
and tried experiments with bullets of 5-in. in length, and obtained considerable range,
and great accuracy with them; the recoil however was excessive, and to use such
bullets heavier arms, a smaller bore, and other modifications would be necessary.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Centre of
gravity
formed by
blunting tips.</p>

<p>He endeavoured to carry the centre of gravity to the furthest possible point
forward, (which Robins suggested 100 years before), but to effect this he was compelled
to flatten the fore end of the bullet, which had the disadvantage of increasing
the resistance of the air to the movement of projection.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Path rectified
by resistance
in rear.</p>

<p>He was then led to another plan for rectifying the path of the bullet through
each instant of projection, and which was by creating at the posterior end, resistances,
which should act in case the axis of the bullet did not coincide with the direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
motion, <span class="sidenote">Many
cannelures.</span>and this was carried out by cutting upon the cylindrical part, instead of one,
as many circular grooves of &middot;28 in depth, as that cylindrical, or rather, slightly
conical, part could contain. An increased precision in firing was the immediate
result. (<a href="#Plate20">Plate 20</a>, fig 15.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Shape of
cannelures.</p>

<p>Feeling his way most carefully, Captain Tamisier then made a great number of
experiments in this direction, and perceived that it was important to render the
posterior surface of the grooves as sharp as possible, so as to augment the action of
the air; for these grooves lose their shape, owing to the lead, from its malleable
nature, yielding under the strokes of the ramrod.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elongated
Projectiles,
whose Centres
of Gravity do
not correspond
with
Centre of
Figure.</p>

<p>Elongated projectiles, whose centres of gravity do not exactly coincide with the
centre of figure, when they do not turn over, tend to preserve their axis in the
primary direction which was imparted to them, in the same manner as an imperfectly
feathered arrow flying with little velocity, the point of the moving body being constantly
above the trajectory, and its axis making a certain angle (<a href="#Plate21">plate 21</a>, fig 1) with
the target to the curve. <span class="sidenote">Action of the
air.</span>Therefore the part <span class="smcapall">A.B.</span> of the bullet being exposed to the
direct action of the air&#8217;s resistance, the atmospherical fluid is compressed on the
surface <span class="smcapall">A.B.</span>, and rarified upon that of
<span class="smcapall">A.C.</span> Hence it will be perceived that the compressed
fluid supports the moving body, and prevents its descending as rapidly as
would a spherical bullet, which is constructed to meet the same direct resistance from
the air. This trajectory will therefore be more elongated than that of the spherical
bullet in question.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Remedied by
the grooves.</p>

<p>But the resistance of the air, acting upon the groove of the projectile, produces,
on the lower part of this groove, an action which tends to bring back its point upon
the trajectory, yet with so little force, that often, in its descent, the projectile turns
over, and moves breadthways at ranges of 1000 and 1200 yards. The lower side of
the projectile, therefore, moving in the compressed air, and the upper in the rarified
air, deviation must ensue, for, as the upper part of the bullet moves from left to right,
the bottom must move from right to left. <span class="sidenote" id="Ref02">Cause of
deviation.</span>But the lower resistance to the motion of
rotation being produced by the friction of the compressed air, is greater than the
upper resistance, which depends on the friction of the rarified air. By combining
these two resistances, there results a single force, acting from left to right, which
produces what Captain Tamisier termed &#8220;derivation,&#8221; <span class="sidenote">Remedy.</span>and it was to overcome this
derivation that this officer proposed the circular grooves to the bullet, which he considered
would act, like the feathers of the arrow, to maintain the moving body in its
trajectory.</p>

<p class="sidenote">How to obtain
knowledge of
the bullet&#8217;s
rotation.</p>





<p>If, however, we would wish to obtain some idea of the rotatory motion of a
bullet in its path through the air, <span class="sidenote">By the arrow.</span>let us consider the action of the arrow, and see how
it is constructed, so that the resistance of the air should not act in an unfavourable
manner. First, nearly all its weight is concentrated at the point, so that its centre of
gravity is close to it. <span class="sidenote">Use of
feathers on
arrows.</span>At the opposite end feathers are placed, the heaviest of which
does not affect the centre of gravity, but gives rise to an amount of resistance in rear
of the projectile, and which prevents its ever taking a motion of rotation perpendicular
to its longer axis, and keeps it in the direction of its projection. This difficulty which<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
the arrow finds in changing its direction must concur in preventing its descending so
rapidly as it would do were it only to obey the law of gravity, and must therefore
render its trajectory more uniform.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Similar effects
on bullet with
grooves.</p>

<p>Let us, however, now come back to the grooves of Mons. Tamisier, and we shall
find that they concur in giving to the bullet the two actions of the resistance of the
air, which we have demonstrated with respect to the arrow.</p>

<p>Suppose that such a bullet describes the trajectory <span class="smcapall">M</span>,
and <span class="smcapall">A.B.</span> be the position of
its axis, it will be seen that the lower part of the bullet re-establishes the air compressed,
whilst the upper part finds itself in the rarified air. That, consequently
the lower parts of the cannelures are submitted to the direct action of the air&#8217;s
resistance, whilst their upper parts totally escape this action. (<a href="#Plate21">Plate 21</a>, fig. 2).
<span class="sidenote">Effect of
grooves.</span>The resultant of the air&#8217;s resistance evidently tends to bring back the point of the
moving body, according to the trajectory; but as this action is produced by the
pressure of an elastic fluid, it results that the point <span class="smcapall">B</span>, after having been an instant
upon the trajectory, will fall below, in virtue of the velocity acquired; but then the
upper grooves finding themselves acted on by the action of the air&#8217;s resistance, this
action, joined to its weight, will force the point of the projectile upwards, which will
descend to come up again, so that the projectile will have throughout its flight a
vertical swing, which is seen distinctly enough in arrows.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Union of
Robins and
Tamisier.</p>

<p>Let us connect the suggestion of Robins, with the experiments of Captain
Tamisier, to cause the posterior end to act as a rudder to guide the projectile in its
true path, as undoubtedly during the descent of a bullet there is a tendency for the
centre of gravity to fall first, as the ball of the shuttlecock. In the first Prussian balls,
and in those used in the Tige, the centre of gravity being nearer the base, the rear
end of these balls have a tendency to fall before the foremost, but this is most
undoubtedly counteracted by grooves, while it would be impossible to fire an
elongated projectile with its centre of gravity backwards, with any accuracy out of a
smooth-bored gun.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cannelures
improved
shooting.</p>

<p>Captain Jervis says that these grooves have the effect of improving the accuracy
of firing when the bullets are not perfectly homogeneous, is certain, <span class="sidenote">Why none in
English bullet.</span>but the British
Committee on small arms justly considered that owing to the careful way in which the
bullets are made in England by compression, these grooves might be dispensed with.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Variety of
forms.</p>

<p>Almost every conceivable form of projectile, internal and external, have been
made and experimented upon. <span class="sidenote">Auxiliaries to
expansion,
various.</span>Auxiliaries to expansion have been used, made of
metal, horn, wood, and leather, with plugs, screws, or cups of divers shapes. Cannelures
are used, of varying forms, depth and number.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rotation from
smooth bores.</p>

<p>It has even been attempted to construct bullets upon the screw principle, so that
the projectile should receive spirality from the action of the air upon its outer or
inner surface, when fired out of a smooth bore musket.</p>

<p class="sidenote">General characteristics
of
modern rifles.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of the European rifles, up to 1850, are a very large
calibre, a comparatively light short barrel, with a quick twist, <i>i.e.</i>, about one turn in
three feet, sometimes using a patch, and sometimes not, the bullet circular, and its
front part flattened by starting and ramming down.</p>

<p class="sidenote">American
alterations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span></p>

<p>It appears that the introduction of additional weight in the barrel, reduction in
the size of the calibre, the constant use of the patch, a slower twist, generally one turn
in 6ft., combined with (what is now known to be a detriment) great length of barrel,
are exclusively American.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Picket bullet.</p>

<p>A round ended picket (<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 16), was occasionally used in some parts of
the States, until the invention of Mr. Allen Clarke, of the flat ended picket, which
allows a much greater charge of powder, producing greater velocity, and consequently
less variation in a side wind.</p>

<p class="sidenote">On the comparative
merits of rifles.</p>

<p>A rifle may perform first rate at short ranges, and fail entirely at long, while a
rifle which will fire well at extreme ranges can never fail of good shooting at short.
In fact certain calibres, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., perform best at certain distances, <span class="sidenote">Points in a
perfect rifle.</span>and in the
combinations of a perfect rifle there are certain points to be attended to, or the weapon
will be deficient and inferior.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Velocity.</p>

<p>It is desirable to give a bullet as much velocity as it can safely be started with,
and the limit is the recoil of the gun, and the liability of the bullets to be upset or
destroyed, for as soon as this upsetting takes place, the performance becomes inferior,
and the circle of error enlarged.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Degree of
twist.</p>

<p>It is clear that a bullet projected with sufficient twist to keep it steady in
boisterous and windy weather, must of necessity have more twist than is actually
necessary in a still favourable time; hence a rifle for general purposes, should always
have too much twist rather than too little.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Weight of
bullet.</p>

<p>The weight of the bullet must be proportioned to the distance it is intended to be
projected with the greatest accuracy; for it is a law, that with bodies of the same
densities, small ones lose their momentum sooner than large ones. It would be
madness to use a bullet ninety to the pound at nine hundred yards, merely because
it performed first rate at two hundred yards; or a forty to the pound at two hundred
yards, because it performed well at nine hundred yards. The reason is that a forty
to the pound cannot be projected with as much velocity at two hundred yards, as the
ninety to the pound can, because the ninety uses more powder in proportion to the
weight of the bullet than the forty does. Again, the heavier bullet performs better
than the lighter one at nine hundred yards, simply because the momentum of the light
ball is nearly expended at so long a range as nine hundred yards, and its rotatory
motion is not enough to keep it in the true line of its flight, whereas a heavy bullet,
having from its weight more momentum, preserves for a longer distance the twist and
velocity with which it started.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Calibre.</p>

<p>As weight of projectile is a leading element in obtaining accuracy at long ranges,
and as the weight cannot be increased beyond a certain limit in small arm ammunition,
hence a small bore is an indispensable requisite for a perfect rifle.</p>

<p>In the foregoing brief summary of the most important properties which should be
possessed by a first class rifle, we have dealt in generalities, <span class="sidenote">Result of Mr.
Whitworth&#8217;s
experiments.</span>but we shall now record
the experience of Mr. Whitworth, who has entered into the most minute details, and
has pointed out the harmony which should subsist between the twist, bore, &amp;c., and
the projectile, in the combinations of a perfect rifle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bore and
weight
limited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span></p>

<p>Premising, that when Mr. Whitworth was solicited by the late honored Lord
Hardinge to render the aid of his mechanical genius to the improvement or perfecting
a military weapon, he was restricted as to length of barrel, viz., 3 feet 3-in., and
weight of bullet, &middot;530 grains. We shall now proceed and use Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s
words.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Consideration
for curve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having noticed the form (hexagonal) of the interior which provides the best
rifling surfaces, the next thing to be considered is the proper curve which rifled
barrels ought to possess, in order to give the projectile the necessary degree of
rotation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Hexagonal
form admits
of quick turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the hexagonal barrel, I use much quicker turn and can fire projectiles of
any required length, as with the quickest that may be desirable they do not &#8216;strip.&#8217;
I made a short barrel with one turn in the inch (simply to try the effect of an extreme
velocity of rotation) and found that I could fire from it mechanically&mdash;fitting projectiles
made of an alloy of lead and tin, with a charge of 35 grains of powder they
penetrated through seven inches of elm planks.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Degree of
spiral fixed.</p>

<p>After many experiments, in order to determine the diameter for the bore and
degree of spirality, Mr. Whitworth adds: &#8220;For an ordinary military barrel, 39 inches
long, <span class="sidenote">Diameter of
bore determined.</span>I proposed a &middot;45-inch bore, with one turn in 20 inches, which is in my opinion
the best for this length. The rotation is sufficient with a bullet of the requisite
specific gravity, for a range of 2000 yards.&#8221; Under these conditions the projectiles
on leaving the gun would be about two and a half diameters of the bore in length.
&#8220;The gun responds to every increase of charge, by firing with lower elevation, from
the service charge of 70 grains up to 120 grains; this latter charge is the largest
that can be effectively consumed, and the recoil then becomes more than the shoulder
can conveniently bear with the weight of the service musket.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advocates of
slow turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The advocates of the slow turn of one in 6 feet 6 inches, consider that a quick
turn causes so much friction as to impede the progress of the ball to an injurious
and sometimes dangerous degree, and to produce loss of elevation and range; but
my experiments show the contrary to be the case. <span class="sidenote">Effects of
quick turn.</span>The effect of too quick a turn,
as to friction, is felt in the greatest degree when the projectile has attained its
highest velocity in the barrel, that is at the muzzle, and is felt in the least degree
when the projectile is beginning to move, at the breech. The great strain put upon
a gun at the instant of explosion is due, not to the resistance of friction, but to the
<i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of the projectile which has to be overcome. In a long barrel, with an
extremely quick turn, the resistance offered to the progress of the projectile is very
great at the muzzle, and although moderate charges give good results, the rifle will
not respond to increased charges by giving a better elevation. If the barrel be cut
shorter, an increase of charge then lowers the elevation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Objections to
increasing
spiral.</p>

<p>&#8220;The use of an increasing or varying turn is obviously injurious, for besides
altering the shape of the bullet, it causes increased resistance at the muzzle, the very
place where relief is wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Length and
spiral
increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finding that all difficulty arising from length of projectiles, is overcome by<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
giving sufficient rotation, and that any weight that may be necessary can be obtained
by adding to the length, I adopted for the bullet of the service weight, an increased
length, <span class="sidenote">Diameter
decreased.</span>and a reduced diameter, <span class="sidenote">Trajectory
lowered.</span>and obtained a comparatively low trajectory; less
elevation is required, and the path of the projectile lies more nearly in a straight
line, making it more likely to hit any object of moderate height within range, and
rendering mistakes in judging distances of less moment. The time of flight being
shortened, the projectile is very much less deflected by the action of the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Proper powder
for expanding
bullets.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most important to observe that with all expanding bullets proper powder
must be employed. In many cases this kind of bullet has failed, owing to the use of
a slowly igniting powder, <span class="sidenote">Powder for
hardened
bullets.</span>which is desirable for a hard metal projectile, as it causes
less strain upon the piece, but is unsuitable with a soft metal expanding projectile,
for which a quickly igniting powder is absolutely requisite to insure a complete
expansion, which will fill the bore. <span class="sidenote">Consequences
of imperfect
expansion.</span>Unless this is done the gases rush past the
bullet between it and the barrel, the latter becomes foul, the bullet is distorted, and
the shooting must be bad. <span class="sidenote">Advantages
of hexagonal
form.</span>If the projectiles used be made of the same hexagonal
shape externally as the bore of the barrel internally, that is, with a mechanical fit,
metals of all degrees of hardness, from lead, or lead and tin, up to hardened steel
may be employed, and slowly igniting powder, like that of the service may be
employed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mr. Whitworth&#8217;s
claims.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth does not lay claim to any originality as inventor of the polygonal
system, but merely brings it forward, as the most certain mode of securing spiral
motion, but he deserves to be honored by all Riflemen, as having established the
degree of spirality, the diameter of bore, to ensure the best results from a given weight
of lead, and length of barrel.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>In achieving the important position obtained by the rifle in the present day, it has
nevertheless effected no more than was predicted of it by Leutman, the Academician
of St. Petersburg, in 1728, by Euler, Borda, and Gassendi, and by our eminent but
hitherto forgotten countryman Robins, who in 1747, urgently called the attention of
the Government and the public to the importance of this description of fire-arm as a
military weapon.</p>

<p>In the War of American Independence, the rifle, there long established as the
national arm for the chase, exhibited its superiority as a <i>war</i> arm also, in so sensible a
manner, that we were constrained to oppose to the American hunters the subsidised
Riflemen of Hesse, Hanover, and Denmark.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Robins&#8217;
prophecy.</p>

<p>We shall close by quoting the last words in &#8220;Robins&#8217; Tracts of Gunnery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever State shall thoroughly comprehend the nature and advantages of rifled
barrel pieces, and having facilitated and completed their construction, shall introduce
into their armies their <i>general</i> use with a <i>dexterity</i> in the
<i>management</i> of them; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
will by this means acquire a superiority, which will almost equal anything that has
been done at any time by the particular excellence of any one kind of arms; and
will perhaps fall but little short of the wonderful effects which histories relate to
have been formerly produced by the first inventors of fire-arms.&#8221;</p>

<h3>DEFINITIONS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Matter.</p>

<p>Matter,&mdash;everything which has weight.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Body.</p>

<p>Body,&mdash;a portion of matter limited in every direction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mass.</p>

<p>Mass,&mdash;the quantity of matter in any body.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Particle.</p>

<p>Particle,&mdash;or material point, is a body of evanescent magnitude, and bodies of
finite magnitude are said to be made up of an indefinite number of particles, or material
points.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Inertia.</p>

<p>Inertia,&mdash;passiveness or inactivity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Attraction.</p>

<p>Attraction,&mdash;a fundamental law of nature, that every particle of matter has a
tendency to be attracted towards another particle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Density.</p>

<p>Density,&mdash;is in proportion to the closeness of the particles to each other.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Volume.</p>

<p>Volume,&mdash;the space bounded by the exterior surface of a body, is its apparent
volume or size.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elasticity.</p>

<p>Elasticity,&mdash;a body that yields to pressure, and recovers its figure again; hence
air and gasses are elastic bodies; lead a non-elastic body.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Motion.</p>

<p>Motion,&mdash;is the changing of place, or the opposite to a state of rest.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Velocity.</p>

<p>Velocity,&mdash;is the rate of motion; there are four rates of motion, viz., Uniform,
Variable, Accelerated, and Retarded.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1st. Uniform.</p>

<p>1st. Uniform,&mdash;when a particle traverses equal distances, in any equal successive
portion of time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">2nd. Variable.</p>

<p>2nd. Variable,&mdash;when the spaces passed over in equal times, are unequal.</p>

<p class="sidenote">3rd. Accelerated.</p>

<p>3rd. Accelerated,&mdash;when the distances traversed in equal times are successively
greater and greater.</p>

<p class="sidenote">4th. Retarded.</p>

<p>4th. Retarded,&mdash;when the distances traversed in equal times are successively
less and less.</p>

<p>Acceleration or Retardation, may also be equal or unequal, that is uniform or
variable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Friction.</p>

<p>Friction,&mdash;arises from the irregularities of the surfaces which act upon one another.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Force.</p>

<p>Force,&mdash;any cause which produces, or tends to produce a change in the state of
rest, or of motion of a particle of matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Measure of
force.</p>

<p>Forces are measured by comparison with weights. Thus any forces which will
bend a spring into the same positions as weights of 1lb., 2lbs., 3lbs., &amp;c., are called
respectively forces of 1lb., 2lbs., 3lbs., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Momentum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span></p>

<p>Momentum,&mdash;or quantity of motion.  If a body moving at first with a certain
velocity is afterwards observed to move with double or triple this velocity, the quantity
of motion of the body is conceived to be doubled or tripled, hence the momentum of
a body, depends upon its velocity, as the quantity of motion of a body is the product
of the velocity by the mass or weight.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Laws of
motion.</p>

<p>The elementary principles upon which are based all our reasonings respecting the
motions of bodies, are called the &#8220;Laws of Motion,&#8221; and as arranged by Sir Isaac
Newton, are three in number.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1st Law.</p>

<p>1st. A particle at rest will continue for ever at rest, and a particle in motion
will continue in motion uniformly forward in a straight line, until it be acted upon by
some extraneous force.</p>

<p class="sidenote">2nd Law.</p>

<p>2nd. When any force acts upon a body in motion, the change of motion which
it produces is proportional to the force impressed, and in the direction of that force.</p>

<p class="sidenote">3rd Law.</p>

<p>3rd. Action and reaction are equal, and in contrary directions. In all cases the
quantity of motion gained by one body is always equal to that lost by the other in the
same direction. Thus, if a ball in motion, strikes another at rest, the motion communicated
to the latter will be taken from the former, and the velocity of the former be
proportionately diminished.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Centre of
Gravity.</p>

<p>Centre of Gravity,&mdash;is that point at which the whole weight of the body may be
considered to act, and about which consequently, the body, when subjected to the
force of gravity only, will balance in all positions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Specific
Gravity.</p>

<p>Specific Gravity,&mdash;the weight belonging to an equal bulk of every different
substance, and is estimated by the quantities of matter when the bulks are the same;
or in other words, it is the density that constitutes the specific gravity. It is agreed
to make pure rain-water the standard, to which they refer the comparative weights
of all other bodies. Lead is about eleven times the weight of the same bulk of water.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Initial
Velocity.</p>

<p>Initial Velocity is the velocity which a bullet possesses on leaving the muzzle of a
gun; and in the speaking of the velocity of bullets fired from the musket now used,
you understand 1200 feet per second, for the Initial Velocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Angular
Velocity.</p>

<p>Angular Velocity is the velocity with which the circular arc is described; and
depends upon the perpendicular distance of the point from the axis of rotation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Terminal
Velocity.</p>

<p>Terminal Velocity: if a cannon ball were to be let fall from a very great height,
it would by the law of gravity, descend with accelerated motion towards the earth,
but as the resistance of the air increases as the squares of velocities, a point would be
reached when the resistance would be equal to the force of gravity, from whence it
would fall to the earth in uniform motion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Eccentric
Body.</p>

<p>An Eccentric Body, is one whose centre of figure does not correspond with the
centre of gravity.</p>

<p>If no force were acting upon the projectile, except the explosive force of gunpowder,
it would by the first law of motion, move on for ever in the line in which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
discharged; this motion is modified by the action of two forces, viz., gravity and the
resistance of the air.</p>

<p>As the early cannons were of the rudest construction, and were used only to force
open barriers, or to be employed against troops at a very short range, it was a matter
of secondary consideration what course the bullet took, indeed it was generally
believed, that it flew for some distance in a straight line, and then dropped suddenly.
Acting upon this opinion we find that most of the early cannon had a large metal
ring at the muzzle, so as to render it the same size as at the breech, and with such as
were not of this construction they made use of a wooden foresight which tied on to
the muzzle, so as to make the line of sight parallel to the axis, by which they conceived
that they might aim more directly at the object which the bullet was
designed to hit.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Leonardo da
Vinci, 1452.</p>

<p>The first author who wrote professedly on the flight of a cannon shot was a
celebrated Italian Mathematician, named Leonardo da Vinci, who explains his manner
of studying phenomena, in order to arrive at safe conclusions, thus: &#8220;I will treat of
the subject, but first of all I will make some experiments, because my intention is to
quote experience, and then to show why bodies are found to act in a certain
manner;&#8221; and taking as his motto, &#8220;Science belongs to the Captain, practice to
the Soldier,&#8221; he boldly asks: &#8220;If a bombard throws various distances with various
elevations, I ask in what part of its range will be the greatest angle of elevation?&#8221;
The sole answer is a small drawing of three curves, (<a href="#Plate20">plate 20</a>, fig. 3.), the greatest
range being the curve about midway between the perpendicular and the horizontal.
Yet this small drawing is very remarkable when we come to examine it. In the first
place, we see that he recognises the fact that the trajectory is a curve throughout its
length; secondly, that a shot fired perpendicularly will not fall again on the spot
whence it was fired. Simple as they may seem, these two propositions recognise the
force of gravity, resistance of the air, and the rotary motion of the earth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Tartaglia,
1537.</p>

<p>The next author who wrote on the flight of cannon shot was another celebrated
Italian Mathematician, named Tartaglia. In the year 1537, and afterwards in 1546, he
published several works relating to the theory of those motions, and although the then
imperfect state of mechanics furnished him with very fallacious principles to proceed on,
yet he was not altogether unsuccessful in his enquiries, for he determined (contrary to
the opinion of practitioners) that no part of the track of a bullet was in a straight line,
although he considered that the curvature in some cases was so little, as not to be
attended to, comparing it to the surface of the sea, which, although it appears to be
a plain, when practically considered, is yet undoubtedly incurvated round the centre
of the earth. It was only by an accident he nearly stumbled upon one truth in the
theory of projectiles, when he stated that the greatest range obtained by equal forces
is at 45&deg;. Calculating that at the angle 0&deg; the trajectory was null, that by raising
the trajectory, the range increased up to a certain point, afterwards diminished, and
finally became null again when the projective force acted perpendicularly, he concluded
that the greatest range must be a medium between these two points, and
consequently at 45&deg;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span></p>

<p>Others thought that a shot, on leaving the muzzle, described a straight line;
that after a certain period its motion grew slower, and then that it described a curve,
caused by the forces of projection and gravity; finally, that it fell perpendicularly.
Tartaglia seems to have originated the notion that the part of the curve which joined
the oblique line to the perpendicular, was the arc of a circle tangent to one and
the other.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Galileo, 1638.</p>

<p>In the year 1638, Galileo, also an Italian, printed his dialogues, in which he
was the first to describe the real effect of gravity on falling bodies; on these
principles he determined, that the flight of a cannon shot, or of any other projectile,
would be in the curve of a parabola, unless it was deviated from this track by the
resistance of the air. A parabola is a figure formed by cutting a cone, with a plain
parallel to the side of the cone.</p>

<h3>GRAVITY.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Bullet as
influenced by
powder and
gravity only.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to consider the course of a bullet, as affected by <i>two</i> forces
only, viz., 1st. The velocity communicated to it by the explosion of the powder;
and 2nd. By the force of Gravity.</p>

<p>The attraction of the earth acts on all bodies in proportion to their quantities of
matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">If no air, all
bodies would
fall in same
time.</p>

<p>The difference of time observable in the fall of bodies through the air, is due to
the resistance of that medium, whence we may fairly conclude, that if the air was
altogether absent, and no other resisting medium occupied its place, all bodies of
whatever size, and of whatever weight, must descend with the same speed. Under
such circumstances, a balloon and the smoke of the fire would descend, instead of
ascending as they do, by the pressure of the air, which, bulk for bulk, is heavier than
themselves. <span class="sidenote">Gold and dry
leaf in same
time.</span>A dry leaf falls very slowly, and a piece of gold very rapidly, but if the
gold be beaten into a thin leaf, the time of its descent is greatly prolonged. If a
piece of metal and a feather are let fall at the same instant from the top of a tall
exhausted receiver, it will be found that these two bodies, so dissimilar in weight,
will strike the table of the air-pump, on which the receiver stands, at the same
instant. Supposing the air did not offer any resistance to the onward course of a
projectile, and that the instantaneous force communicated to a bullet, from the explosion
of the gunpowder, were to project it in the line <span class="smcapall">A.B.</span> (<a href="#Plate21">plate 21</a>, fig. 4.) from the
point <span class="smcapall">A.</span>, with a velocity that will send it in the first second of time as far as <span class="smcapall">C.</span>, then
if there were no other force to affect it, it would continue to move in the same direction <span class="smcapall">B.</span>,
and with the same velocity, and at the next second it would have passed over
another space, <span class="smcapall">C.D.</span>, equal to <span class="smcapall">A.C.</span>, so that in the third second it would have reached
<span class="smcapall">E.</span>, keeping constantly in the same straight line.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bullet under
two forces,
powder and
gravity.</p>

<p>But no sooner does the bullet quit the muzzle, than it immediately comes under
the influence of another force, called the force of gravity, which differs from the force
caused by the explosion of the powder, which ceases to influence the bullet, after it
has once communicated to it its velocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">An accelerating
force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">Effect of gravity.</span>Gravity is an accelerating force, acting constantly upon, and causing the bullet
to move towards the earth, with a velocity increasing with the length of time the
bullet is exposed to its influence. It has been found from experiment that this
increase of velocity will cause a body to move through spaces, in proportion to the
squares of the time taken to pass over the distance. Thus, if a body falls a given
space in one second, in two it will have fallen over a space equal to four times what it
fell through in the first second, and in the three first seconds it will have fallen
through a space equal to nine times that which it fell through in the first second.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Result of gravity.</p>

<p>The consequence of this principle is, that all bodies of similar figure, and equal
density, at equal distances from the earth, fall with equal velocity; <span class="sidenote">Course of the
bullet.</span>and if a body
describes a space of 16ft. in the first second of time, it will, in the next second of
time, fall <i>three</i> times 16, or 48 feet, and thus will have fallen, from the time it first
dropped, four times 16 feet, or 64 feet, because 4 is the square of 2, the time the
body was falling. In the third second, it will fall 5 times 16 feet, or 80 feet, and
these sums collectively, viz., 16 + 48 + 80 = 144 feet, the whole distance described
by the falling body in three seconds of time.</p>

<p>From this it is evident, that instead of moving in a straight line <span class="smcapall">A. B.</span>,
(<a href="#Plate21">plate 21</a>,
fig. 5.), the bullet will be drawn from that course.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Parabolic
theory.</p>

<p>From the point <span class="smcapall">C.</span>, draw <span class="smcapall">C. F.</span>,
equal to the space that the bullet may be supposed
to fall in one second of time, then at the end of the first second of time the bullet will be
at <span class="smcapall">F.</span>, instead of at <span class="smcapall">C.</span>, and will
have moved in the direction <span class="smcapall">A. F.</span>, instead of <span class="smcapall">A. C.</span>; at
the end of the next second it will have fallen a total distance <span class="smcapall">D. G.</span>, equal to four times
<span class="smcapall">C. F.</span>, thus the bullet will have fallen at the end of the third
second a distance <span class="smcapall">E. H.</span>, equal
to nine times <span class="smcapall">C. F.</span>, and it will have moved in the line
<span class="smcapall">A. F. G. H.</span> instead of the straight
line <span class="smcapall">A. B.</span>, in which it would have moved, had it not been affected by the force of gravity.
The curve <span class="smcapall">A. H.</span>, is of the form called a Parabola, and hence the theory is called the
&#8220;Parabolic Theory.&#8221; It is founded on the principle that the velocity given to the
bullet by the explosion of the gunpowder is continued throughout its course, but
this would only be true in vacuo, and is therefore of little value in calculating the
real course of the bullet in the air.</p>

<h3>ON THE TIME TAKEN TO DRAW A BALL TO THE GROUND BY
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">If fired with
axis parallel
to the ground.</p>

<p>1st Case. Supposing a ball to be fired when the axis of the piece is parallel to
the ground and 16 feet above it, then the projectile will strike the earth in the same
length of time that it would have done, had it been rolled out of the muzzle, quite
irrespective of the velocity with which it may have been propelled, or the consequent
extent of range; that is to say the ball will have reached the point
<span class="smcapall">B.</span>, (<a href="#Plate22">plate 22</a>, fig. 1.),
in the same length of time that it would require to fall from the muzzle <span class="smcapall">A.</span>, to the earth
<span class="smcapall">C.</span>; <i>i. e.</i>, in one second.</p>

<p>2nd Case. Were three guns to be fired at the same instant, with their three
axes parallel to the horizon as before, and loaded respectively with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drm., 1 drm., and
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drm. of powder of the same strength, then,
although the three initial velocities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
three ranges would consequently all be different, yet the three balls would strike the
ground at the same time, <i>i. e.</i> at the points <span class="smcapall">B. B. B.</span>
in one second. (<a href="#Plate22">Plate 22</a>, fig. 2.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">If axis at an
angle to the
ground.</p>

<p>3rd Case. When a ball is fired at an angle of elevation it will reach the earth
in the same length of time which it would occupy in falling the length of the tangent of the
angle of projection; hence supposing <span class="smcapall">F. G.</span> (<a href="#Plate22">plate 22</a>, fig. 3.) to be 16 feet, the ball
would reach the point <span class="smcapall">G.</span> in one second, irrespective of the distance from
<span class="smcapall">D.</span> to <span class="smcapall">G.</span></p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>ATMOSPHERE.</h3>

<p>Let us now take into our consideration the course of a projectile while under the
influence of <i>three</i> forces, viz., powder, gravity, and air.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Why named.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, or sphere of gases, is the general name applied to the whole
gaseous portion of this planet, as the term ocean is applied to its liquid, and land to
its solid portions.</p>

<p>Being much lighter than either land or water, it necessarily floats or rests upon
them, and is in sufficient quantity to cover the highest mountains, and to rise nine or
ten times their height, to about 45 miles above the sea level, so as to form a layer over
the whole surface, averaging probably between forty and fifty miles in thickness, which
is about as thick, in proportion to the globe, as the liquid layer adhering to the surface
of an orange, after it had been dipped in water.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Composition
of air.</p>

<p>It consists essentially of two gases, called oxygen and nitrogen, and also contains
a variable quantity of aqueous vapour.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Qualities of
air.</p>

<p>In common with matter in every state, the air possesses impenetrability. It can
be compressed, but cannot be annihilated. It has weight, inertia, momentum, and
elasticity.</p>

<p>In consequence of its weight is its pressure, which acts uniformly on all bodies,
and is equal to between 14lbs. and 15lbs. on every square inch of surface at the
sea-level.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early idea of
air&#8217;s resistance.</p>

<p>The first experiments that were made on projectiles, were carried out on the idea
that the resistance of the air would not materially affect the track of a bullet which
had great velocity. <span class="sidenote">How air acts.</span>But the moment a body is launched into space, it meets with
particles of the air at every instant of its movement, to which it yields part of its
velocity, and the air being a constant force, the velocity of the body decreases at every
instant from the commencement of its motion.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>RESULT OF THE AIR&#8217;S RESISTANCE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Robins, 1742,
showed effect
of air&#8217;s resistance.</p>

<p>It remained for Robins, 1742, in a work then published, to show the real effect
of the atmosphere upon moving bodies. He proved by actual experiment, <span class="sidenote">Course of ball
was not a
parabola.</span>that a
24lb. shot did not range the fifth part of the distance it should have done according
to the parabolic theory. If a cannon shot moved in a parabolic curve, then from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
known properties of that curve, it was evident that when fired with elevation, the
angle of descent of the bullet should have been the same as the angle at which it was
projected, and this he showed was not the case in practice. Now Robins acknowledged
the opinion of Galileo, as regards the force of gravity, to be correct; he could not
therefore attribute to him any miscalculation on the score of gravity. <span class="sidenote">Why not a
parabola.</span>He therefore
concluded, that the error of the &#8220;parabolic theory&#8221; arose from the supposition that
the bullet continued to move at the same velocity throughout its course.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ballistic
pendulum.</p>

<p>Robins tried a series of experiments by firing at a ballistic pendulum at different
distances; the oscillation of this pendulum enabled him to calculate the velocity of the
bullet, at the time it struck the pendulum, and by this means he ascertained, that
according to his expectations, the bullet moved slower in proportion as it became
more distant from the point at which it was fired. This diminution he attributed to
the resistance of the air.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Trajectory
more curved
than a parabola.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is evident that instead of moving over equal spaces
<span class="smcapall">A. C.</span>, <span class="smcapall">C. D.</span>,
<span class="smcapall">D. E.</span>, (<a href="#Plate22">plate 22</a>, fig. 4), at each succeeding second of time, it will require
considerably longer to traverse each succeeding distance, and the force of gravity will
consequently have longer time to act upon it, and will have the effect of lowering the
bullet much more than it would do according to the &#8220;parabolic theory;&#8221; moreover
it is evident, that as the velocity of the bullet diminishes, the trajectory or path
followed by the bullet, will become still more incurvated.</p>

<p>Having now proved the error of the &#8220;parabolic theory,&#8221; Robins began his
endeavours to calculate the actual course of the bullet, according to this new theory
which he had demonstrated, but this calculation was necessarily attended with great
difficulties, for in so doing a number of circumstances had to be considered.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Resultant.</p>

<p>The resultant of the three forces acting on a projectile, (<a href="#Plate23">plate 23</a>, fig. 1), viz.,
gunpowder, gravity, and the resistance of the air, is a motal force, diminishing in
velocity at every instant, causing the projectile to describe a curved line in its flight,
the incipient point of the curve lying in the axis of the bore of the piece, and its
continuation diverging in the direction of the attraction of gravity, till the projectile
obeys the latter force alone.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>EXPERIMENTS IN FRANCE.</h3>

<p>It is stated by Captain Jervis, R.A., in the &#8220;Rifle Musket,&#8221; that &#8220;From
experiments made in France, <span class="sidenote">Angle for
greatest
range.</span>it has been found that the greatest range of the
common percussion musket, with spherical bullet fired with the regulation charge, was
at 25&deg;; yet, by theoretical calculation, it should be 45&deg;; <span class="sidenote">Velocity.</span>also that the usual velocity
was some 500 yards per second, whilst in vacuum it would be 19,792 yards per
second.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Elevation
giving certain
range.</p>

<p>&#8220;At an angle of from 4&deg; to 5&deg;, the real range was about 640 yards; without the
resistance of the air, and at an angle of 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg;, it would be 3,674, or six times
greater.&#8221;</p>

<h3>ON THE EFFECT OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR UPON THE
MOTION OF A PROJECTILE.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">The effect of
the air&#8217;s resistance
upon
the motion of
a projectile.</p>

<p>The effect of the resistance of the atmosphere to the motion of a projectile, is a
subject of the greatest importance in gunnery. It has engaged the attention of the
most eminent philosophers, and on account of the great difficulty of determining by
experiment, the correctness of any particular hypothesis, much difference of opinion is
entertained as to the absolute effect of this retarding force upon bodies moving in the
atmosphere with great velocities; and although sufficient is known to guide the
practical artillerist in that art to which he is devoted, still as a scientific question, it is
one of considerable interest, but more on account of the difficulty of its solution, than
from its practical importance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Mr. Robins&#8217;
discoveries.</p>

<p>To our distinguished countryman, Mr. Benjamin Robins, is due the credit of not
only being the first practically to determine the enormous effect of the resistance of
the air in retarding the motions of military projectiles, but also of pointing out and
experimentally proving other facts with regard to this resistance, which will be noticed
when considering the subject of the deviation of shot from the intended direction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Result of Dr.
Hutton&#8217;s experiments.</p>

<p>After him, Dr. Hutton made a great number of experiments upon the same point,
viz., the effect of the resistance of the air upon bodies moving in that medium, both
with great and small velocities; and the inferences which he drew from these experiments,
although not absolutely true, are sufficiently correct for all practical purposes.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>ON THE RESISTANCE OF A FLUID TO A BODY IN MOTION.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Circumstances
affecting
the resistance
which a
body meets
with in its
motion in a
fluid.</p>

<p>The resistance which a body meets with in its motion through a fluid will depend
upon three principal causes, <span class="nowrap">viz:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1st. Its velocity, and the form and magnitude of the surface opposed to
the fluid.</p>

<p>2nd. Upon the density and tenacity of the fluid or cohesion of its particles,
and also upon the friction which will be caused by the roughness of the surface of
the body.</p>

<p>3rd. Upon the degree of compression to which this fluid, supposed to be perfectly
elastic, is subjected, upon which will depend the rapidity with which it will
close in and fill the space behind the body in motion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The resistance
of a fluid to a
body as the
squares of the
velocities.</p>

<p>Firstly, with regard to the velocity of the body. It is evident that a plane
moving through a fluid in a direction perpendicular to its surface, must impart to the
particles of the fluid with which it comes in contact, a velocity equal to its own; and,
consequently, from this cause alone, the resistances would be as the velocities; but
the number of particles struck in a certain time being also as the velocities, from
these two causes combined, the resistance of a fluid to a body in motion, arising from
the inertia of the particles of the fluid, will be as the square of the velocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cohesion of
the particles
of a fluid, and
friction.</p>

<p>Secondly, a body moving in a fluid must overcome the force of cohesion of those
parts which are separated, and the friction, both which are independent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
velocity. The total resistance then, from cohesion, friction, and inertia, will be
partly constant and partly as the square of the velocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Result.</p>

<p>The resistances therefore are as the squares of the velocities in the same fluid,
and as the squares of the velocities multiplied by the densities in different fluids.</p>

<p>Hitherto, however, we have imagined a fluid which does not exist in nature;
that is to say, a <i>discontinued</i> fluid, or one which has its particles separated and <i>unconnected</i>,
and also perfectly non-elastic.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Atmosphere,
and its properties
bearing
on the
question of its
resistance.</p>

<p>Now, in the atmosphere, no one particle that is contiguous to the body can be
moved without moving a great number of others, some of which will be distant from
it. If the fluid be much compressed, and the velocity of the moving body much less
than that with which the particles of the fluid will rush into vacuum in consequence
of the compression, it is clear that the space left by the moving body will be almost
instantaneously filled up, (<a href="#Plate23">plate 23</a>, fig. 2); and the resistance of such a medium
would be less the greater the compression, provided the density were the same,
because the velocity of rushing into a vacuum will be greater the greater the compression.
Also, in a greatly compressed fluid, the form of the fore part of the body
influences the amount of the retarding force but very slightly, while in a non-compressed
fluid this force would be considerably affected by the peculiar shape which
might be given to the projectile.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Resistance increased
when
the body
moves so fast
that a vacuum
is formed behind
it.</p>

<p>Thirdly. If the body can be moved so rapidly that the fluid cannot instantaneously
press in behind it, as is found to be the case in the atmosphere, the resisting
power of the medium must be considerably increased, for the projectile being deprived
of the pressure of the fluid on its hind part, must support on its fore part the whole
weight of a column of the fluid, over and above the force employed in moving the
portion of the fluid in contact with it, which force is the sole source of resistance in
the discontinued fluid. Also, the condensation of the air in front of the body will
influence considerably the relation between the resistances and the velocities of an
oblique surface: and it is highly probable that although the resistances to a globe
may for slow motions be nearly proportional to the squares of the velocities, they will
for great velocities increase in a much higher ratio.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>ON THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH AIR WILL RUSH INTO A VACUUM.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">The velocity
of the rush of
air into a
vacuum.</p>

<p>When considering the resistance of the air to a body in motion, it is important
that the velocity with which air will rush into a vacuum should be determined; and
this will depend upon its pressure or elasticity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Result.</p>

<p>It has been calculated, that air will rush into a vacuum at the rate of about 1,344
feet per second when the barometer stands at 30 inches, so that should a projectile be
moving through the atmosphere at a greater velocity than this, say 1,600 feet per
second, then would there be a vacuum formed behind the ball, and instead of having
merely the resistance due to the inertia of the particles of the air, it would, in addition,
suffer that from the whole pressure of a column of the medium, equal to that indicated
by the barometer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span></p>

<h2>UPON THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR TO
BODIES OF DIFFERENT FORMS.</h2>

<hr class="chapline top" />
<hr class="chapline bot" />

<p class="sidenote">Difficulties of
the question.</p>

<p>The influence of the form of a body upon the resistance offered to it by a fluid,
is a problem of the greatest difficulty; and although the most celebrated mathematicians
have turned their attention to the subject, still, even for slow motions, they
have only been able to frame strictly empirical formula, founded upon the data derived
from practice; while with regard to the resistance at very high velocities, such as we
have to deal with, very little light has hitherto been thrown upon the subject.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Compressed
fluid.</p>

<p>When a body moves in the atmosphere, the particles which are set in motion by
the projectile, act upon those in proximity to them, and these again upon others; and
also from the elasticity of the fluid, it would be compressed before the body in a
degree dependant upon the motion and form of the body. Moreover, the atmosphere
itself partakes so much of the nature of an infinitely compressed fluid, as to constantly
follow the body without loss of density when the motion is slow, but not when the
velocity is great, so that the same law will not hold good for both. In an infinitely
compressed fluid (that is, one which would fill up the space left behind the body instantaneously)
the parts of the fluid which the body presses against in its motion
would instantaneously communicate the pressure received by them throughout the
whole mass, so that the density of the fluid would not undergo any change, either in
front of the body or behind it, consequently the resistance to the body would be much
less than in a fluid partially compressed like the atmosphere; and the form of the
body would not have the same effect in diminishing or increasing the amount of
resistance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">When a
vacuum is
formed behind
the ball.</p>

<p>When the velocity of a body moving in the atmosphere is so great that a vacuum is
formed behind it, the action of the fluid approaches to that of the discontinued fluid.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH SLOW MOTIONS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Resistance in
proportion to
surface.</p>

<p>1st. It appears from the various experiments that have been made upon bodies
moving in the atmosphere, that the resistance is nearly as the surface, increasing a very
little above that proportion in the greater surfaces.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Resistance as
squares of
velocity.</p>

<p>2nd. That the resistance to the same surface with <i>different</i> velocities, is in <i>slow</i>
motions nearly as the squares of the velocity, but gradually increasing more and more
in proportion as the velocities increase.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rounded and
pointed ends
suffer less resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span></p>

<p>3rd. The round ends, and sharp ends of solids, suffer less resistance than the
flat or plane ends of the same diameter. Hence the flat end of the cylinder and of a
hemisphere, or of a cone, suffer more resistance than the round or sharp ends of the same.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Sharp ends
not always
least resistance.</p>

<p>4th. The sharper ends have not always the smaller resistances; for instance, the
round end of a hemisphere has less resistance than the pointed end of a cone, whose
angle with the axis is 25&deg; 42&#8242;.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of base
affects resistance.</p>

<p>5th. When the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms, the resistances are
different, though the fore parts are the same. Hence the resistance to the fore part
of a cylinder is less than that on the equally flat surface of the cone or hemisphere,
owing to the shape of the <i>base</i> of the cylinder. The base of the hemisphere has less
resistance than the cone, and the round side of the hemisphere less than that of the
whole sphere.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Only proved
for slow motions.</p>

<p>The above refers only to <i>slow</i> motions, and the results given, from experiments
with very small velocities; and it is to be expected, that with very rapid motions the
form of the fore, as well as the hind part, of the projectile, will influence the amount
of resistance in a much higher degree.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of hind
part.</p>

<p>That form for the hind part will be best which has the greatest pressure upon it,
when moving with a certain velocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Best shape for
fore and hind
part.</p>

<p>The ogivale form seems, from experiment, to fulfil the former condition. The
best form for the <i>hind</i> part, for <i>rapid</i> motions, has not been determined; it may,
however, be considered to be of much less importance than the shape of the fore part.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form determined
by extent
of range.</p>

<p>Of course the best form can be determined by extent of range, but deductions
from this will depend upon such a variety of circumstances, the effects of some of
which must be entirely hypothetical, that the correctness of any formul&aelig; obtained in
this manner must be very uncertain.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form suggested
by Sir
I. Newton.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, in his &#8220;Principia,&#8221; has given an indication of that form of
body, which, in passing through a fluid, would experience less resistance than a solid
body of equal magnitude of any other form. It is elongated.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Axis of elongated
bodies
must be fixed.</p>

<p>It is plain, however, that the minimum of resistance would not be obtained with
a shot of an elongated form, unless the axis can be kept in the direction of the trajectory;
as not only will the axis perpetually deviate from the true direction, but the
projectile will turn over and rotate round its shorter axis, that is, if fired out of a
smooth bore.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages of
conical bullets.</p>

<p>Conical bullets have an advantage, from their pointed end, which enables them
to pass through the air with greater facility; and for the same reason they are better
calculated to penetrate into any matter than spherical ones.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Disadvantages
of conical
bullets.</p>

<p>A <i>solid</i> bullet cannot be pointed without sending backward the centre of gravity.
The sharper the point, the more it is liable to injury, and if the apex of the cone
does not lie true, in the axis of the projectile, then such an imperfection of figure is
calculated to cause greater deflections in the flight than any injury which a round
surface is likely to sustain. In penetrating into solid bodies, it is also important that
the centre of gravity should be near its work.</p>

<h3>RESISTANCE OF THE AIR, AS AFFECTED BY THE WEIGHT OF
PROJECTILES.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Resistance
overcome by
weight.</p>

<p>Bodies of similar volume and figure overcome the resistance of the air in proportion
to their densities. The amount of the air&#8217;s resistance is in proportion to the
magnitude of the surface.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Contents of
circles.</p>

<p>The superficial contents of circles are as the <i>squares</i> of their diameters. Hence
if the ball <span class="smcapall">A.</span> (<a href="#Plate23">plate 23</a>, fig. 3) be
2in. in diameter, and the ball <span class="smcapall">B.</span> 4in., the amount of
resistance experienced would be as four to sixteen.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Contents of
spheres.</p>

<p>The cubical contents, or weights of spheres, are in proportion to the <i>cubes</i> of
their diameters. Hence the power to overcome resistance in the balls <span class="smcapall">A</span>
and <span class="smcapall">B</span> would
be as <i>eight</i> to <i>sixty-four</i>. Thus the power to overcome resistance increases in much
greater proportion than the resistance elicited by increasing the surface.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advantages of
elongated bullets.</p>

<p>Suppose an elongated body to have the diameter of its cylindrical portion equal to
that of the ball <span class="smcapall">A.</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="smcapall">E.F.</span> =
<span class="smcapall">C.D.</span>, (<a href="#Plate23">plate 23</a>, fig. 4), and elongated so that its
weight should be equal to that of the spherical shot <span class="smcapall">B.</span>, it is evident that it would
meet equal resistance from the air, to the ball <span class="smcapall">A.</span>, having, at the same time, as much
power to overcome resistance as the body <span class="smcapall">B.</span></p>

<p>Elongated balls, by offering a larger surface to the sides of the barrel, are less
liable to be affected by any imperfections in the bore; whereas the spherical ball,
pressing only on its tangential point, will give to any little hollows, or undulations,
wherever they occur.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Balls cannot
be expanded.</p>

<p>A spherical ball cannot be expanded into the grooves, unless there be very little
windage, except by blows from the ramrod, the gas escaping round the circumference
of the ball, and giving it an irregular motion while passing down the barrel; <span class="sidenote">Elongated
projectiles
easily expanded.</span>but an
elongated projectile can be readily expanded, and the facility of doing so is in proportion
to the difference of length between its major and minor axis.</p>

<h3>DEVIATIONS OF PROJECTILES FROM SMOOTH-BORED GUNS.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">Causes of deviation
of
shot.</p>

<p>Very great irregularities occur in the paths described by projectiles fired from
smooth-bored guns. It is a fact well known to all practical artillerists, that if a
number of solid shot or any other projectile be fired from the same gun, with equal
charges and elevations, and with gunpowder of the same quality, the gun carriage
resting on a platform, and the piece being laid with the greatest care before each
round, very few of the shot will range to the same distance; and moreover, the
greater part will be found to deflect considerably (unless the range be very short) to
the right or left of the line in which the gun is pointed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Four causes of
deviation.</p>

<p>The causes of these deviations may be stated as follows:&mdash;1st, Windage; 2nd,
Rotation; 3rd, Wind; 4th, from Rotation of the Earth.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>1st CAUSE, WINDAGE.</h4>

<p class="sidenote">Action from
windage.</p>





<p>Windage causes irregularity in the flight of a projectile, from the fact of the elastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
gas acting in the first instance on its upper portion, and driving it against the bottom
of the bore; the shot re-acts at the same time that it is impelled forward by the
charge, and strikes the upper surface of the bore some distance down, and so on by a
succession of rebounds, <span class="sidenote">False direction.</span>until it leaves the bore in an accidental direction, and with a
rotatory motion, depending chiefly on the position of the last impact against the bore.
Thus should the last impact of a (concentric) shot when fired from a gun be upon the
right hand side of the bore, as represented, (<a href="#Plate23">plate 23</a>, fig. 5); the shot will have a
tendency to deflect to the left in the direction. <span class="sidenote">Gives rotation.</span>While at the same time a rotation
will be given to it in the direction indicated by the arrows.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>2nd CAUSE, ROTATION.</h4>

<span class="sidenote">Rotation
without translation.</span>

<p>Every body may have a twofold motion, one by which it is carried forward, and
the other by which it may turn round on an axis passing through its centre, called a
motion of rotation.</p>

<p>When a body has only a motion of translation all the particles of which it is
composed move with equal swiftness, and also in parallel directions; and by the first
law of motion, every particle put in such motion will constantly move with the same
velocity in the same direction, unless it be prevented by some external cause.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rotation.</p>

<p>By a motion of rotation, a body without changing its place, turns round on an
axis passing through its centre of gravity. <span class="sidenote">Rotation and
translation
combined.</span>A body may have at the same time both
a progressive and rotatory motion, without either disturbing the other, and one may
suffer a change from the action of some external force, while the other continues the
same as before.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Force through
centre of
gravity,
causes progressive
motion
only.</p>

<p>If the direction of the force be through the centre of gravity, it causes a progressive
motion only, that is, if the body was at rest before, it will move forward in
the direction of the impressed force.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Effect of force
on a body in
motion.</p>

<p>If a body had a progressive motion before, then impressed force will cause it to
move faster or slower, or to change its direction, according as the direction of this
second force conspires with or opposes its former motion, or acts obliquely on its
direction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rotation not
disturbed by
second force
in direction of
centre of gravity.</p>

<p>If a body, besides its progressive motion had a motion of rotation also, this last
will not be changed by the action of a new force passing through the centre of gravity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Rotation of
force does not
pass through
the centre of
gravity.</p>

<p>If the direction of the force does not pass through the centre of gravity, the
progressive motion will be altered, and the body will then also acquire a rotatory
motion round an axis passing through the centre of gravity, and perpendicular to a
plane passing through the direction of the force and this centre.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>CASES BEARING UPON THE FOREGOING THEORY.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">When ball is
perfectly
round, centre
of gravity
coincides with
figure, and no
windage.</p>

<p>1st Case. Suppose the ball to be perfectly round, its centre of gravity and
figure to coincide, and let there be no windage. In this case the force of the powder
not only passes through the centre of gravity of the shot, but proceeds in a direction
parallel to the axis of the bore, and there would be but small friction due to the
weight of the shot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">If windage
then rotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span></p>

<p>2nd Case. But as there is a considerable amount of friction between the bore
and the projectile in the case where there is windage, the direction of this force being
opposite to that of the gunpowder, and upon the surface of the ball, it will therefore
give rotation to the shot.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Eccentricity
causes rotation.</p>

<p>3rd Case. Suppose the ball to be perfectly round, but its centre of gravity not
to coincide with the centre of figure. In this case the impelling force passes through
the centre of the ball, or nearly so, and acts in a direction parallel to the axis of the
piece; but if the centre of gravity of the ball lie out of the line of direction of the
force of the powder, the shot will be urged to turn round its centre of gravity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Angular velocity.</p>

<p>The angular velocity communicated to the body will depend, firstly, upon the
length of the perpendicular from the centre of gravity upon the direction of the impelling
force, and secondly, upon the law of density of the material or the manner
in which the metal is distributed. The direction of rotations will depend upon the
position of the centre of figure with regard to that of gravity. (<a href="#Plate23">Plate 23</a>, fig. 6.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Robins&#8217;
remarks.</p>

<p>Robins remarks, bullets are not only depressed beneath their original direction by
the action of gravity, but are also frequently driven to the right or left of that direction
by the action of some other force. If it were true that bullets varied their direction
by the action of gravity only, then it ought to happen that the errors in their flight to
the right or left of the mark, should increase in proportion to the distance of the mark
from the firer only.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Deflection not
in proportion
to distance.</p>

<p>But this is contrary to all experience, for the same piece which will carry its
bullet within an inch at ten yards, cannot be relied upon to ten inches in one hundred
yards, much less to thirty inches in three hundred.</p>

<p>Now this irregularity can only arise from the track of the bullet being incurvated
sideways as well as downwards. The reality of this doubly incurvated track being
demonstrated, it may be asked what can be the cause of a motion so different from
what has been hitherto supposed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">1st cause of
increase, deflection.</p>

<p>1st Cause. Is owing to the resistance of the air acting obliquely to the progressive
motion of the body, and sometimes arises from inequalities in the resisted
surface.</p>

<p class="sidenote">2nd cause,
from whirling
motion.</p>

<p>2nd Cause. From a whirling motion acquired by the bullet round its axis, for
by this motion of rotation, combined with the progressive motion, each part of the
bullet&#8217;s surface will strike the air in a direction very different from what it would do
if there was no such whirl; and the obliquity of the action of the air arising from this
cause will be greater, according as the rotatory motion of the bullet is greater in proportion
to its progressive motion; and as this whirl will in one part of the revolution
conspire in some degree with the progressive, and in another part be equally opposed
to it, the resistance of the air on the fore part of the bullet will be hereby affected,
and will be increased in that part where the whirling motion conspires with the
progressive; and diminished where it is opposed to it. <span class="sidenote">Direction of a
shot influenced
by
position of
axis round
which it
whirls.</span>And by this means the whole
effort of resistance, instead of being in a direction opposite to the direction of the
body, will become oblique thereto, and will produce those effects we have already
mentioned. For instance, if the axis of the whirl was perpendicular to the horizon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
then the incurvation would be to the right or left. If that axis were horizontal to
the direction of the bullet, then the incurvation would be upwards or downwards.
But as the first position of the axis is uncertain, and as it may perpetually shift in the
course of the bullet&#8217;s flight, the deviation of the bullet is not necessarily either in one
certain direction, nor tending to the same side in one part of its flight that it does in
another, but it more usually is continually changing the tendency of its deflection, as
the axis round which it whirls must frequently shift its position during the progressive
motion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Doubly incurvated
track.</p>

<p>It is constantly found in practice that a shot will deviate in a curved line, either
right or left, the curve rapidly increasing towards the end of the range. This most
probably occurs from the velocity of rotation decreasing but slightly, compared with
the initial velocity of the shot, or, if a strong wind is blowing across the range during
the whole time of flight, the curve would manifestly be increased according as the
velocity of the ball decreased.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF ROBINS&#8217; THEORY OF ROTATION.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">With ball and
double string.</p>

<p>1st Illustration. A wooden ball 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter suspended by a double
string, nine feet long. It will be found that if this ball receive a spinning motion by
the untwisting of the string it will remain stationary. If it be made to vibrate, it will
continue to do so in the same vertical plane. But if it be made to spin while it
vibrates it will be deflected to that side on which the whirl combines with the progressive
motion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">By firing
through screens.</p>

<p>2nd Illustration. By firing through screens of thin paper placed parallel to each
other, at equal distances, the deflection or track of bullets can easily be investigated.
It will be found that the amount of deflection is wholly disproportioned to the increased
distance of the screens.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bent muzzle.</p>

<p>3rd Illustration. To give further light upon this subject, Mr. Robins took a barrel
and bent it at about three or four inches from the muzzle to the left, the bend making
an angle of 3&deg; or 4&deg; with the axis of the piece.</p>

<p>By firing at screens it was found that although the ball passed through the first
screens to the left, it struck the butt to the right of the vertical plane on which aim
was taken in line of the axis of the unbent portion of the barrel. This was caused by
the friction of the ball on the right side of the bent part of the muzzle, causing the
ball to spin from left to right.</p>

<h3>ON ECCENTRIC PROJECTILES.</h3>

<p class="sidenote">How to find
centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Sir Howard Douglas, in his &#8220;Naval Gunnery,&#8221; states:&mdash;&#8220;The position of the
centre of gravity can be found by floating the projectile in mercury, and marking
its vertex. Then mark a point upon the shot diametrically opposite to that point,
which will give the direction of the axis in which the two centres lie. Thus the
shot can be placed in the gun with its centre of gravity in any desired position.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;On making experiments, it appeared that not one shot in a hundred, when
floated in mercury, was indifferent as to the position in which it was so floated, but
turned immediately, until the centre of gravity arrived at the lowest point, and
consequently that not one shot in a hundred was perfect in sphericity, and homogeneity.
Shells can be made eccentric by being cast with a solid segment in the
interior sphere, left in the shell, or by boring two holes in each shell, diametrically
opposite to one another, stopping up one with 5lbs. of lead, and the other with
wood. <span class="sidenote">Effect of
eccentricity.</span>When the centre of gravity was above the centre of the figure, the ranges
were the longest, and when below, the shortest. When to the right or left hand,
the deviations were also to the right or left. The mean range which, with the usual
shot, was 1640 yards, was, with the shot whose centres of gravity and of figure
were not coincident, the centre of gravity being upwards, equal to 2140 yards,
being an increase of 500 yards.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ricochet of
eccentric shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;With respect to the ricochet of eccentric spherical projectiles, the rotation
which causes deflection in the flight, must act in the same manner to impede a
straight forward graze. When an ordinary well formed homogenous spherical
projectile, upon which probably very little rotation is impressed, makes a graze, the
bottom of the vertical diameter first touches the plane, and immediately acquires, by
the reaction, a rotation upon its horizontal axis, by which the shot rolls onwards
throughout the graze, probably for a straight forward second flight. But in the case
of an eccentric spherical projectile, placed with its centre of gravity to the right or
to the left, its rotation upon its vertical axis during the graze must occasion a fresh
deflection in its second flight, and it is only when the centre of gravity is placed in
a vertical plane passing through the axis of the gun, that the rotation by touching
the ground will not disturb the direction of the graze, though the extent of range
to the first graze will be affected more or less according as the centre of gravity may
have been placed upwards or downwards. Whether the rebounds take place from
water, as in the experiments made on board the &#8220;Excellent,&#8221; or on land, as those
carried on at Shoeburyness, the shot, when revolving on a vertical axis, instead of
making a straight forward graze, suffered deflection which were invariably towards
the same side of the line of fire as the centre of gravity; and at every graze up to
the fourth, a new deflection took place.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Knowledge
derived from
experiments
with eccentric
shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The results of these very curious and instructive experiments fully explain the
extraordinary anomalies, as they have heretofore been considered, in length of range
and in the lateral deviations: these have been attributed to changes in the state of
the air, or the direction of the wind, to differences in the strength of the gunpowder,
and to inequalities in the degrees of windage. All these causes are, no doubt, productive
of errors in practice, but it is now clear that those errors are chiefly
occasioned by the eccentricity and nonhomogeneity of the shot, and the accidental
positions of the centre of gravity of the projectile with respect to the axis of the
bore. The whole of these experiments furnish decisive proof of the necessity of
paying the most scrupulous attention to the figure and homogeneity of solid shot, and
concentricity of shells, and they exhibit the remarkable fact that a very considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
increase of range may be obtained without an increase in the charge, or elevation
of the gun.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">No advantage
in using
eccentric projectiles.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that eccentric projectiles would be applicable for general
purposes, on account of the degree of attention and care required in their service, nor
would much advantage be gained by their use, as the momentum is not altered, and
it is only necessary to give the ordinary shot a little more elevation in order to strike
the same object.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Range of elongated
projectiles
at certain
low elevations
greater
in air than in
vacuo.</p>

<p>There is another point of great importance with regard to the range of elongated
projectiles. It is asserted by Sir W. Armstrong and others, that at certain low
elevations the range of an elongated projectile is greater in the atmosphere than in
vacuo, and the following is the explanation given by the former of this apparent
paradox. &#8220;In a vacuum, the trajectory would be the same, whether the projectile
were elongated or spherical, so long as the angle of elevation, and the initial
velocity were constant; but the presence of a resisting atmosphere makes this
remarkable difference, that while it greatly shortens the range of the round shot, it
actually prolongs that of the elongated projectile, provided the angle of elevation
do not exceed a certain limit, which, in my experiments, I have found to be about
6&deg;. This appears, at first, very paradoxical, but it may be easily explained. The
elongated shot, if properly formed, and having a sufficient rotation, retains the same
inclination to the horizontal plane throughout its flight, and consequently acquires
a continually increasing obliquity to the curve of its flight. Now the effect of this
obliquity is, that the projectile is in a measure sustained upon the air, just as a kite
is supported by the current of air meeting the inclined surface, and the result is
that its descent is retarded, so that it has time to reach to a greater distance.&#8221;</p>

<p class="sidenote">Charge.</p>

<p>The form and weight of the projectile being determined as well as the inclination
of the grooves, the charge can be so arranged as to give the necessary initial velocity,
and velocity of rotation; or if the nature of projectile and charge be fixed, the
inclination of the grooves must be such as will give the required results. The most
important consideration is the weight and form of projectile; the inclination of the
grooves, the charge, weight of metal in the gun, &amp;c., are regulated almost entirely by
it. The charges used with rifle pieces are much less than those with which smooth-bored
guns are fired, for little or none of the gas is allowed to escape by windage,
there being therefore no loss of force; and it is found by experience that, with
comparatively low initial velocities, the elongated projectiles maintain their velocity,
and attain very long ranges.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>The original language has been retained, including inconsistencies and errors in spelling, hyphenation, capitalisation,
etc., except as mentioned below.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all elements may display as intended.</p>

<p>Original Table of Contents: as present in the source document. The reason for the order of entries is not clear, and some chapters
are not listed, nor are the sections. The structure of the text has been determined based on what seemed the most logical
interpretation of (the lay-out of) the chapter and section headings in the text.
The Extended Table of Contents in the back of the book has been created for this text on the basis of this assumed structure;
the page numbers i through iv have been inserted for this Table of Contents.</p>

<p>The text refers to the plates by both Roman and Arabic numbers. This has not been standardised. The numbering of the actual
plates has been standardised.</p>

<p>The illustrations in the plates in the back of the book have been individually scaled for better visibility. Where relevant,
links to larger versions of the illustrations have been provided (not available in all formats).</p>

<p>Page 29, great inconvenience ... quite preclude: as printed in the source document.</p>

<p>Page 29 and 35 (and Errata), sulphite and sulphide: as printed in the source document.</p>

<p>Page 30 and 31, calculations: as printed in the source document.</p>

<p>Page 44, Slings were used in 1572, at the siege of Sancere by the Huguenots, in order to save their powder: there should be a
comma after Sancere, the Huguenots were the besieged party.</p>

<p>Page 47, Our forefathers ... public schools: considered to be a section heading.</p>

<p>Page 66, both the king&#8217;s feed men: other sources mention Peter Bawd and Peter Vancollen / Van Collen as freed men.</p>

<p>Page 107, weight of bullet, &middot;530 grains: as printed in the source document, but unlikely to be correct.</p>

<p>Page 114, paragraph on Parabolic theory: even with the corrections mentioned in the errata, some of the reference letters are
missing; <span class="smcapall">F</span>, <span class="smcapall">G</span> and <span class="smcapall">H</span> are presumably the
ends of the vertical lines through <span class="smcapall">C</span>, <span class="smcapall">D</span> and <span class="smcapall">E</span>
respectively.</p>

<p>Page 119, strictly empirical formula: should probably have been a plural.</p>


<p class="blankbefore1">Changes made:</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to directly after the paragraph to which they refer.</p>

<p>Some minor obvious punctuation and typographical errors have been corrected silently.</p>

<p><span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>/<span class="smcapall">B. C.</span> and
<span class="smcapall">A.D.</span>/<span class="smcapall">A. D.</span> have been standardised to <span class="smcapall">B. C.</span>
and <span class="smcapall">A. D.</span>, respectively. Minie, Mini&egrave; (the spelling used most commonly in this book) and
Mini&eacute; have been standardised to Mini&eacute;.</p>

<p>The (corrected, see below) Errata have already been applied to the text.</p>

<p>Errata:  Page 32, para. 6, line 10 changed to Page 32, para.7, line 10; IX and XII changed to ix and xii; Page 84, para. 2,
line 1 (2nd entry) changed to Page 84, para. 3, line 1. Subalterns changed to subaltern officers; Page 91, para. 5 changed to Page
